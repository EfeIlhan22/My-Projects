"Any news on expanding the stadium or building new stadium. As much as I am Chelsea fan , We clearly need to increase our capacity..."
Its all gone quiet since the Battersea failed bid. I also think the pitch share holders are making it very hard for the club. No chance of making the bridge bigger from what ive heard and read. Health and safety wont allow it as there arent enough exit points out of the stadium. Not sure how true that is though. 
Yeah it looks like we are pretty much stuck where we are for a few years at least.
I don't think their is any obvious options at present within the desired 3 mile radius of Stamford Bridge.
"From a purely selfish perspective I hope we never leave the bridge, I love it. "
Battersea would have been brilliant with the pipes and all.

"Perhaps when QPR have dropped and are in financial difficulties, we coul build on that site....Big ground basically ours that they can share"
"I would rather we didn't move unless it was to Battersea, planning laws can and do change, so maybe one  day, with the right Architect and a good prevailing wind, we'll be able to expand the Bridge.."
From what ive heard the only real way of extending the bridge is to knock down the bates motel. I dont see that ever happening.
"i would have been so incredibly jealous of you guys if you'd have got battersea down, it would have been something else, im kinda glad you didnt though just so it can look the same as it did on the pink floyd album "

"Like I say planning laws can change, its not the capacity that is the problem as I understand it, but the access on to the Fulham Road, health and safety...if they could build an underground exit from behind the Matthew Harding that comes out somewhere near Seagrove Road that could be an option, but the club cannot get permission for that....yet..plus it could be prohibitively expensive"
I remember Ken Bates trying to build a walk way towards the Lillie road.
"The sad thing about Battersea is, they are letting an iconic building fall to pieces, in the hope of getting permission to build on it, when it eventually falls down..I think its owned by a Malaysian consortium although I could be wrong about that....the fabric of the building is getting more and more decrepit, where the roof has gone."
There have been lots of thoughts on how to do it. A bridge over the train tracks was another. Yet none of them work thus the club not going through with them or not being allowed to do them. I cant see The Bridge getting any bigger at all. The only choice would be to move but its not that easy trying to find the right plot of land is it. Battersea would have been amazing but the gready fat cats went for other plans. *cough*bribe*cough*
I dont want to leave the bridge. Like many of us on here we watch it develop into the stadium it is today however battersea would have been amazing with the chimneys and all the history behind the building. It would have been designed inside I'm sure like Dortmunds ground. 
It still boils down to the only exits going out onto the Fulham road.

yeah its so iconic that just leaving it to rot would be a crime
Wouldnt it be nice if Chelsea waited a year or two and then put a bid in to the owners for it.

Battersea Power Station would have been an amazing stadium.
There's only enough square footage around Stamford Bridge to expand the current stadium by about 5 thousand which is not big enough for what the club wants.
Couldnt they continue the old thoughts of a railtrack especially for away fans at the north end of the Bridge.....Thatll take 5000 away with
Battersea Power Station would have been an amazing stadium.
Why did it fail? I can't remember.
"No way do we need a new stadium. We can barely sell out our home games! Not interested in another modern, soulless bowl to fill up with more tourists and day trippers. Stamford Bridge is our home. End of"

We probably need another 5-10 seasons to grow to a true household name like ManU and Arsenal to justify 65k seater. The club seems to think we need it already...
Speculate to accumulate - Battersea would have been an excellent proposition especially as prices were potentially lowered for younger fans
"No way do we need a new stadium. We can barely sell out our home games! Not interested in another modern, soulless bowl to fill up with more tourists and day trippers. Stamford Bridge is our home. End of"
 
"If we do move to a new stadium, and I hope that we don't.  The board should seriously consider an area for youngsters to attend for only ten to fifteen pound a game.  Would encourage future generations of Blues to start attending."
There's a nice stadium complex that could easily be expanded not three mile from where I live. Shame it's in Northamptonshire
"The thing is though, we do need a bigger stadium."

"No way do we need a new stadium. We can barely sell out our home games! Not interested in another modern, soulless bowl to fill up with more tourists and day trippers. Stamford Bridge is our home. End of"
We didnt come all this way to share our ground. No way.

I would say it is a case of if you build it they will come. 
It worked for whoever invented the vibrator.
You have to speculate to accumulate! 
As sales of celery plummeted...shame
With regards to the young generation thing: most young people are going to the likes of fulham and clubs in lower divisions as tickets are cheaper.

"Rumours that there's an announcement coming not too much further into the future, though no-one knows exactly what this will be."
Where or indeed what are the rumours?

"How far in the future we talking? I am not interested in Battersea or moving anywhere tbh. If it's a potential re-development getting capacity up to 50,000 that will do us perfectly."
"what sort of announcement could it be? still need to sort out the CPO issue for anything to happen. tbh, i hope we expand rather than move"
"I think battersea would be amazing to be honest, it would be one of the most iconic stadiums in the world if it was done right. But i thought that was completely dead since the malaysians bought it?"

I go back with chelsea circa 67/68.........I love all that stamford bridge has been to us and of course always will be to us...(BUT)one reason id like to leave the Bridge is that im sick to the pit of my stomach hearing us outsung on our own turf coz the away sh*te have the noisiest part of the bloody ground...I want that 15000 chelsea end...Yep im a selfish B..
Take the roof of the MH and extend the upper tier so it goes up as high as the east and west. That would create a big sweeping bowl and this is only guess work but i'm sure your talking about 750-1000 seats taking into account the corners and about 10-15 rows. You could even go back further who knows.
Then you have the issue of health and safety signing that off. I heard one of the big issues with making the bridge bigger is there are not enough exits away from the ground.
"The exits excuse doesn't really wash with me, anyone whose been to Wembley knows that it all pretty much leads out to the same place but that didn't stop them building a 90k stadium."
"It's not only about capacity though, a new stadium would generate a lot more in revenue."
the issue i see with expansion is that it could come at substantial cost and once finished we would be in a situation where we would probably be unable/unwilling to expand any further for a long time. a new stadium would enable us to drastically increase capacity with the added bonus of having potential room for further expansion if/when necessary
"The same old rumours ect go round & round every few months, i'll believe any building work be it at SB or elsewhere when i see it & its confirmed."

When Le Arse moved from Highbury to the Emeriates a lot of my gooner friends season tickets went up from £600 to £1200 ....  That's a big increase

"The exits reason is because the ground needs to be evacuated within 5 minutes of an emergency. Also, if Craven Cottage increases by 6000, that takes it up to 30k, which they may well be able to evacuate in that time and they'd need to prove that to the council in order to get planning permission."

This is from last years consultation between the CPO and H&F Council. 55k can be done and the Council are more than happy to back these plans.

"I think its all of those reasons mate, tickets are too expensive now(i've been priced out of PL games only do cup ties now) pay £50/£60 at the cheapest price to sit next to a day tripper, no atmosphere, crap kick off time, or spend the same amount in your local or at a CFC pub with like minded mates, i know what i prefer & it doesnt involve day trippers."
"so you've both stopped going to premier league games, and you call the people who go every week day trippers ??"
"I agree with your points entirely Carshalton. I mean I'm 21, so I didn't experience 'the good old days with the good old lads' as it were. I was an ST holder for several years, but had to stop going due to work commitments. I still go to the odd cup game and a few away games up north (at uni at Newcastle), but I've found my viewing experience a lot more enjoyable not at the bridge, which is a real shame. You still get that thrill of knowing you're there at SB, but as an overall package watching the game with mates or fellow Chelsea fans at a pub is just overall better. There is no way it should be like that, but it is for many fans who would create for a better SB (Not saying I would contribute positively- although I like to think I do)."
"so you've both stopped going to premier league games, and you call the people who go every week day trippers ??"
Managed to grab this list of top 30 attendance list out in Europe.
Do Barca really only get an average gate of 70k?

"Strange if true, that would suggest they have 30k empty seats most weeks! "
"I havent given up i had no choice, i was a st holder for years i got made redundant & my mrs was pregnant at the same time, i had two st's back then but had to give them up the following season, that was 2002, i'm a club member & last season done about 18 games, two PL aways QPR & Spurs, QPR i was owed money so that paid for my ticket, Spurs i was in the home end on a st & paid £35,one friendly away(bha) & the rest league cup/FA cup/CL group & every home europa games, but only becuase tickets are £15/£20 cheaper than a basic PL ticket, it doesnt sound a lot that i'm saving but add it up with travel, food,booze ect then it adds up."

"I really don't want to leave SB. It's been our home for as long as we have been a football club. So if we were to move, the new one would have to be spectacular or I'd be really disappointed. We don't want some soul-less piece of crap like the Emirates or City's new ground."
What one might see are seats not used at arsenal...(but) these could be season tickets paid up but not in attendance ..thats why youll still see capacity as the attendance..................................i think
"Have to agree. I am from Belfast, I watch every game but can only go to a handful of games at best every year because of all the travel costs, I am a day tripper, but not through choice..."
They have to bring back terracing. Look at the attendances and atmosphere in Germany. I keep going on about it but it would solve many issues.
"Lads i dont mean the likes of you, Chelsea fans who have been there & seen it, if you look at some of my posts on various threads you'll see i've Chelsea mates in Adalaide, Glasgow & in the north of England who bar my aussie mate come to the odd games, i mean the sort of day trippers that only come because of a holiday in London & because its fashionable now the same sort of people that would jump ship to Man Utd or Arsenal for example, football tourists, who wants to sit next to people like that because i dont, with their phones & camera's out at every throw in, corner ect"

"Far too many rumours & not enough concrete movement! I love the Bridge, but a bigger stadium will be needed in the near future!"
"Those tickets that the ""tourist"" obtained are available to anyone and likely came from a season ticket holder that sold their ticket.  Are you saying that a season ticket holder that sells some of their games to supplement the cost of the season ticket is not a true fan because they are letting a ""tourist"" buy their tickets?  I am from the states and if I ever make it to a match at the Bridge, I will be a day tripper.  Does that make me less of a fan? "
"Well I suppose the argument would be that its not simply about trying to get the biggest attendances and most amount of money in the pocket of the club. The reason its important to get certain fans in is because they are the club. They are it's soul. They're what make it what it is.Not guys who are just interested in the league, liked the look of Chelsea and decided to have a field day at the megastore.I'm sorry if it upsets anyone,but they are simply not the same level of fan who has been following the team for years, home and away,possibly with family connections to the club. "
I will try to say this without stirring up too much trouble....But be careful about assigning levels of fans based on time following a club. New fans are usually beneficial to a club.  They also tend to be more active in positively supporting the club (especially financially).  A longer history with the club does not mean that they are a better or smarter type of fan.  Positive support is still positive support.
"What I'm saying is, fine, if you got to appeal to people to sell shirts fine, but they arn't gonna be the ones there when things really go wrong. It's vital for the club to remain accessible for its core fanbase"
"That's the trick isn't it? The team wants to turn new fans into its core fanbase, making that fanbase larger.  The larger fanbase means that even when people leave if things go wrong there are still plenty of fans to support the team. That leaves a larger core fanbase (new and old). Not all longstanding fans will live forever.  "
Yeah you might be right.
"I've said before that the least money makers for the club are the die hard match goers as they and very little beyond the ticket. They want the day trippers who come and buy a shirt, scarf, commemorative mug or the corporate box owners. "
"The problem is, the club aren't trying to grow fanbase the same way the Blackhawks did. In a big sports city like Chicago, teams are trying to get people in the arena over the different sports teams. The fanbase grew because people from Chicago embraced the team due to the success."
"I've said before that the least money makers for the club are the die hard match goers as they and very little beyond the ticket. They want the day trippers who come and buy a shirt, scarf, commemorative mug or the corporate box owners."
Arsenal as a football club had to pay for their new stadium.
that means Arsenal level ticket prices
"If you build a new stadium, at least some prices will go up.  If you are lucky, the additional seats are the lowest price levels. It really depends on how many more seats a new stadium would produce.  Hopefully adding some kind of corporate suites would allow for the ticket prices to not raise dramatically.  "
Interesting stuff here on the ticket pricing and fanbase.
"Just been reading through this and felt compelled to comment.  The notion that a life time supporter like Carshalton Blue should be happy that Chelsea can now fill a stadium whilst charging top dollar as it helps the club compete financially is farcical.  He has just said that he, and many of his friends, have been priced out of attending every game (something which he has done for his whole life....his main hobby and passion)....yet he is in some way supposed to be happy about this?  ""Well I can't afford to go any more......but at least there is a Japanese tourist in my seat paying 70 quid for a ticket so I guess I should be happy that the club are coining it in."""
Nobody has said that 'tourists' or any fan is not welcome at the club. I said in my original post that all CFC fans are welcomed the more the merrier.

"Once the team was bought by a billionaire, it has been changed forever.  Unfortunately, the club will no longer provide the longtime fans with the same experiences of the past (good and bad).  I would be disheartened too if I had supported the club for all those years."

"It looks too narrow, although the area to the right hand side of the site doesn't look particularly notable, so could maybe be bought up. Anyone who knows the area able to verify what this land is?"
"I'd be delighted with Earl's Court. In terms of location, clearly the best option if we have to leave the Bridge."
Lillie Bridge eh ?
"If the club officially christen the place Earls Court, I'm sold."
"Welcome to the modern world, Lofty! Unfortunately it's inevitable that the new stadium will have a corporate name, like Samsung Stadium. "
"Ah well, us stadium name snobs will call it Earls Court in the same manner that the more discerning Arsenal fans refer to their soulless corporate bowl ground as Ashburton Grove."
The Samsung Arena. Well if they're going to put in a substantial amount into the project then they would have every right to expect their name in lights so to speak. People might not like the idea right now but if Arsenal fans can get used to The Emirates I'm sure we could get used to whatever ours would be called. The bottom line is it wouldn't be Stamford Bridge so it wouldn't be as if we were renaming our current home. 
Lillie Bridge once hosted an FA Cup final would you believe ..
"I really hope this goes through, I love Stamford Bridge and our roots, but there's no denying that we have to move forward with the times, and to progress as a club, a new stadium will be needed!"

"So it seems that this piece of land is indeed ""awkward"" in its narrowness to build a stadium on, however it is a VERY significant opened door to Earl's Court."
If we went there we could just keep the name Lillie Bridge. Then we could still call it the Bridge
Sorry state of affairs really when the official site has nothing whatsoever on this story and we need to rely on the fan sites to find out what's happening. Is the official site really only good for squeezing another few shillings out of us with whatever is the latest money spinning wheeze?

"I bet one of the reasons for the high prices is the fairly small capacity of Stamford Bridge. Bigger stadiums tend to have more reasonably priced tickets available as well as the expensive ones. Now just about every seat is premium priced, because of the small capacity."
Arsenal didn't get any cheaper and I can see us being in the same boat. The supporters always loose out.

The camaraderie of the Shed End is outstanding. Who needs the likes of Buck and Gourlay when you have our fine upstanding spirit behind the club?

What are people's thoughts on the whispers surrounding Linford Christie Stadium / Wormwood Scrubs?
"Well, if we are to move, it looks increasingly likely it will have to be North West, where one of Wormwood Scrubs, Old Oak Common or White City may be viable, all of which are in the same borough we're in now (if I'm not mistaken), Hammersmith & Fulham."
"For those of you that take an interest in such things, all three sites are north of SB, i.e. further north of the river than we are already, whereas Battersea was the only site we've been linked with that was south of the river. These things can be meaningful, particularly for Londoners."

While this is large enough for the current capacity of 41,837, it is generally accepted by stadium architects and construction companies that a new 60,000 stadium would require approximately 18-20 acres of land in a largely square or rectangular shape."""
Post from CFCnet:
 
Quite upsetting that we cant upgrade our own stadium. 
"So the club hasn't stated the need to move but obviously seat expansion is a major priority for this administration. In other words we need to move, just wish something could be done, but even Spurs who have had an easier go at a move haven't completed their stadium yet. Still this can't be our barometer, we need to really push the pedal in order to build that 60,000 seater (with room for further expansion as mentioned in the article)."
"Do not know why there is such an obsession with staying in cramped London SW, there is plenty of space around here, why just at the back of me is 60 acres, it is only 3.5 / 4hrs from the bridge, prefect."
"Must admit my opinion has changed on this. I was quite happy to stay at the bridge until recently when we seem to be selling out home games quite quickly and some of my non member mates can no longer get tickets and this hasn't been the case in previous seasons. I always felt 60,000 was a bit top heavy and we wouldn't fill it but now I think we will, and to become self sufficient we need that extra revenue the additional crowd will bring. So lets make those hard decisions and get it sorted! For me Battersea would of been good but as that is a no goer I feel anywhere in the old heartlands is a must, maintain our identity. Just think a top league game where almost any member could go or a capital one cup game where its a tenner a ticket!!!!"
I would love to sit in the main supporter stand without watching the game through a letter box

Well if you ask nicely your neighbour might let you in to watch it
Ha ha brilliant.  I agree with xfactor the view is shocking from the back of the Mhl.
"I'm a shed lower fella normally, but FF is ok you just wont be able to see the high balls goal kicks etc. I'm in EE for the Soton game hoping for a better atmosphere then the Shed lower offered me against Fulham. But it will still be a letter box having said that Xfactor. Take the tickets, sing your heart out and enjoy the game!"
Was in the Mhl at the back a few times I felt it was the same as the back of the shed lower.  Atmosphere would be good at the back of the Mhl.
"Speaking of MHL and shocking view. I have been offered a couple of tickets in row FF, are those too far back if you actually want to see the match."
"Yes, its awful. I was away up towards the very back of the MHL in the worst seats imaginable once, nearly got a creak in the neck trying to see the action because of the fecking roof! Never again."

This might sound silly but if I go to a game and we get bet and we create a good atmosphere I don't mind getting bet as much.  If we won and the atmosphere was sh*t I'd be pissed off.  For me it's all about the atmosphere and a few pints before the game.  If you want to sit on yours and be quite go to a theatre.

Had a similar experience for Villa at home this year too. I guess you just have to log in at 6.59 on the day the tickets go on sale and hope for the best!
"Spot on Bluegraham, i'm with you on that. Performance off and on the pitch is important, the only difference is I have a few more beers after the match and a celebratory ruby if we win."
Did I not mention after match shame on me. Hoping to get tickets for palace Monday if your going I'll meet you for a beer
^^^ Cheap Date.
"Munch, I've still got some of those old one pound notes!   "
The big hand written ones?
"Sadly not able to make Palace as i'm working. Next match is Southampton if your about I'll def meet for a light ale? Ive been driniking in the Lillie and the prince of wales this season but happy anywhere there is alcohol to be honest, lol!"
"Blimey should be able to sing Chelsea songs all year round, surely its time a law was passed. I think we have a this chat before Graham, I must try out the Goose. Just PM me if your about for a match hopefully we can sort something."
No hassel
"Chelsea’s only realistic hope of matching the £ millions earned by United and Arsenal would be to move to a larger stadium. Chelsea’s chairman, Bruce Buck, pointed out that Stamford Bridge was only the eight largest stadium in the Premier League and 60th biggest in Europe."
Its a shame we cant buy out the surrounding buildings and make some space / find a way to expand the Bridge!
 
"Remember, ticket prices will probably go down and will be made much more accessible if we have a bigger capacity so I don't think we'll have a problem filling 95% of the stadium. Bearing in mind a 60k capacity stadium mean 3000 - 6000 tickets for Away support. "

I think that is a nice idea but realsitically that is a pipe dream.
I said 3000 - 6000 because some the away fan allocation is 5 - 10% depending on the game. Arsenal just gave us 9000 tickets for the CoC game. That's more than 10%. 
"Of course in cup games the away allocation would be bigger, just as it is at the Bridge where they get 6,000 (at reduced prices I would add) however for the Premiership games which is the bread & butter in terms of revenue I think the allocation would be no greater than 3,000."
"Arsenal are paying for the entire thing themselves though, they dont have much choice. Im sure Abramovich will take some of the heat for a new stadium"
Chelsea will not fill a 60000 seater stadium with current prizes no way.
"Abramovich may invest heavily in the project (most likely in the form of an interest free loan), I still don't think ticket prces would go down."
"This. There's no logic to any club forking out £500m for a new stadium and then reducing ticket prices. It would barely be worth moving in the first place. The aim is to generate as much income as possible, plus the stadium will have to be paid for on top of all the other expenses. I think a lot of fans are going to end up disappointed if they're expecting a new stadium to result in cheap tickets."
Can you see a 60000 seater stadium selling out with the current ticket prices? I can't. Chelsea will hope to make money of hospitality tickets. Its all guessing at the moment.
""
"But then 60,000 people paying £30 to get in would generate barely more matchday revenue than we do currently. From the club's point of view, moving to a new stadium has to be worthwhile financially, otherwise why bother? An extra 10,000 fans paying current prices would probably be worth more."
Nobody said £30. It would never be that cheap. Of course it has to be worthwhile financially just can't see it selling out at current prices. The move of stadium would be to get new fans and even older fans back going again with current prices it won't sell out.
"The main aim of a new stadium would be to generate as much money as possible, not win back older fans with cheaper tickets. I'm not sure we'd sell out 60,000 at current prices either. Who knows, another ten years as successful as the last ten and maybe we will. Perhaps I'm just cynical, but I fully expect them to charge as much as they can get away with and still have a reasonably full stadium.[/quot"
"That younger lot also spend a sh*t ton more on overpriced beer and other assorted odds and ends. The extra price of our beer alone pays for 350,000 wages a year compared to other teams. Now just add another 15-20,000 thirsty lads n lasses."

"If we get outbid theres not much we could do perhaps. The prototype sketch up looks sweet and I know its only an example,  but I wouldnt like the pitch to be that far from the fans."
If we did move battersea would be amazing
"The battersea ground got sold to someone last year, didn't it?"
I did a bit of reading and it seems we're waiting in the wings if things break down with the Malaysian developers who currently have the bid.  I don't see why they wouldn't award it to us considering we wanted to restore the iconic building as part of the design.  I would have thought the council would have prioritised that.  But it seems unlikely we'll ever get to see that.  Would have been the best stadium in Europe IMO.

"I thought it was a done deal ?....last proposed move I saw suggested was to Lille Bridge, just to the north of us...It's a train yard, big site too...There used to be a stadium there at one time, but got destroyed in a riot !!!...Battersea wouldl have been ideal though"
"It's nothing short of scandalous the way the BPS site has been allowed to rot and fall apart since the mid 1980's. Ever since then it has changed hands more times than I care to remember, always in the hands of speculators and developers who came up with grand schemes that amounted to jack."
"Battersea would be a superb stadium, one of the best in Europe and most certainly of the most iconic, but I doubt we'll get it."

It's mad to think cup finals where played at lille bridge depot
Maybe we should think of ground sharing the Olympic Stadium  
The battersea stadium with the dortmund-style stands and whatnot looked amazing. Gutted we couldn't get that.

Has there been any news in the last few weeks related to the stadium situation?
Let's keep our fingers crossed this has something to do with Chelsea!
"I heard a rumour yesterday that the plans have been drawn up to redevelop Stamford Bridge into a 60,000 seater stadium. The feeling seems to be that it's the preferred option for all parties and will be approved. Not sure where the extra will go (though we were speculating), or if we'll have to move elsewhere while the building work is being done. Sounds promising though. "

"I've heard nothing new but I remember that the council was trying to get us to stay at Stamford Bridge and would probably be no trouble when it came to planning, but I thought they said it was prohibitively expensive to expand?"
I dont think thats true at all. There simply isnt the space around the ground to build unless the hotel and offices are knocked down. Also it has been said many times that it wouldnt be allowed to have those kind of numbers because of the lack of exits out of the ground. 
Here's the quote I remembered:
"Is there any real room in earls court for a 60,000 seater stadium?"

We could go to our second home Wembley! 
Should have gone for the Olympic stadium. Can't believe West Ham are going to ever going to even half fill that.
Why don't we just buy Twickenham off the RFU? Then lease it back to them for the five days a year they actually use it.
I like that Idea englishman - my sister lives walking distance from Twickers!  It's more or less where I grew up so would fantastic idea for me!

Wrong side of London - would completely lose our identity.
It looks really shabby.
Really?  Have only been in it once since it was redeveloped and that was for a concert.  Seemed alright and certainly looks a lot better from the outside than it did 30 years or so ago !

One of the things that has always been levelled at us is the fact that we don't sell out SB so what would be the point in building a new ground or even increasing capacity. Several teams supporters and in particular dippers and spuds seem to be the main offenders
How close is it to stamford bridge.
This is what i saw from images:
"Twickenham's about 7-8 miles from Fulham so not particularly close but, crucially for me, still West London.  I've no idea if it would ever be feasible, I'm just selfishly liking the idea because it's home turf for me (albeit I last lived in the area in my teens, which is a year or two back now....).  a few good pubs in the area, and I'd know where to park (ie at my sister's)"
"The second one is the side view - I don't think most stadiums look good around the edges.  Whenever I drive past it, it looks pretty impressive.  The front view is this:"
"I've been to Twickenham for a few rugby matches and it's a pretty nice stadium, but has little in the way of character.  There is no way we'd get it though, for one Six Nations is right in the middle of the Premier League season, and there is usually a Christmas tour for the Southern Hemisphere to come and spank us.  We're going to have to build our own if the Bridge can't be expanded which I'm actually fine with.  The designs for the Battersea stadium were magnificent, and even if we can't have that we can extrapolate that Roman wants to do something unique."
"It does look nice from there. Maybe a bit of touching up to make it look more like a Chelsea stadium. Not too sure we could fill 82, 000 though."

Surprised to see so many people consider Twickenham a decent option.

"People need to stop worrying about the cost of individual match tickets.  That's not going to change or have much of an impact on how big a stadium we need or can fill.  The extra revenue comes from two main sources, 1 is corporate areas, we have nowhere near enough at SB and there's huge money to be made from those.  The other is tourists, a tourist comes into London and wants to see a well known London club play football, currenlty for a lot that's not Chelsea because you can't get tickets easily, those tourists then become attached to the club they've seen, they go home and buy a new kit every year, so do their family and people around them, because these things spread, all of a sudden our world wide fan base increases dramatically meaning even more revenue from marketing in these far flung parts of the world."

I think most Twickenham residents would hate the idea!  Lol - the idea of all those nasty working class football fans invading their nice middle class area - I like the idea even more!   Seriously I think the local opposition would be huge!
Looking at the BPS designs really depresses me. Would of been a lovely stadium.
Surprised to see so many people consider Twickenham a decent option.
Would prefer this...its taking too long for Malaysians. .can't we have battersea now....so near down the river Thames. ..fantastic location. ..
"The 6 nations is 2 games one spring, and 3 the next. It would be possible to ensure we play away when England have a fixture. Then there are the autumn internationals - three in November. Again, you could ensure we are away or playing midweek to avoid clashes."

Dont Wigan have regular rugby on their ground?
Can you imagine the hassle involved of contentiously having having to respray and remove the the playing area lines for rugby and football? Also rugby often has large painted advertisements on the playing surface which would need to be removed. 
Dont Wigan have regular rugby on their ground?
"Yeah and look where that's got them.<br /><br /><br />To be honest, if nothing else I don't think the RFU need the income that a ground share would bring and they pride Twickenham on being the home of Rugby so I don't think they or fans would welcome a football team playing there. <br /><br />A ground share at the Olympic stadium is more likely because the ground holders recently said they wouldn't rule out West Ham having to share with Leyton Orient because it's about maximising revenues to get back the costs of the stadium build and conversion to a football stadium."
"haha I wouldnt think that having a rugby team play there has been at a major detriment to their success, their lack of resources and fans however is."
Neither do I to be honest
The grass inspectors wouldnt be happy!! All those expensive lights would be wasted on a chopped up pitch too 
Yeah and look where that's got them.
It's a bugger to get from West to East London.  Wouldn't like that at all.

"We can get a 70,000 in there people have been building bridges and tunnels for 100's of years for access. Roman knows he cant take his money with him. Enjoy it and f**k off hammersmith and fulham council at the same time sweet."
"No, we failed in our bid and the site has gone to a Malaysian consortium who will be building office spaces and apartments on the site. "
"Well it's still slightly possible, if unlikely.  That site has been desolate for around 30 years now, changing hands constantly and everyone so far has failed to develop the land.  It's possible that the Malaysians will be no different, and their project is joint with another company which means relations could break down.  I'm not sure what the time limit is though, they could have it for 10 years before they're forced to sell if they don't do anything with it."
Will hate to leave the bridge but its a must if it can't be expanded significantly.
"Yup, the consortium have already began work since their successful bid."
"No idea at all and I'd be more than happy with twickers as a short term measure, I just don't see it happening. They might even take a lot longer with it and not kick us out while building works take place. I don't know!"
"Chances of Battersea are as good as zero unless Setia runs into serious unforeseen difficulty with it, which seems unlikely given the unprecedented financial and political backing this project has. There is (/was) a standing offer on the table from us to take the power station off Setia's hands and also contribute financially to the tube station but they seem to have to have turned their noses up at this, and Phase One of the redevelopment which includes the work on the power station itself has already started."
Can we really do much with the bridge though expansion wise?

What's keeping the Malaysians from getting this started?
"Any other new stadium plans? Batter wouldve been great seems likely we will end up holding our breath for nothing- besides updating the bridge, or moving to the old train station, where are chelsea fc going to end up calling home in the future?"
"No fresh updates on this, I suppose"
Nope
What's keeping the Malaysians from getting this started?
"I watched a programme on the expansion of London etc and the Malaysians consortium were on it. They've already sold hundred of apartments, which haven't even been built yet. They are going ahead and doesnt look likely that we have a way in."
There's only enough square footage around Stamford Bridge to expand the current stadium by about 5 thousand which is not big enough for what the club wants.
"Yeah, saw that and it did send shivers up my spine. Yet, I thought it would have been quite awesome, and would have involved some engineering clout to boot, to basically move two of the chimneys so that the four chimneys were actually the four corners of the stadium. Imagine a mostly blue stadium with the four white chimneys lit with spotlights at night."
Battersea laid empty for so many years.............. It's BS and sad for us. 
"Another instance of local culture being impeded by businessmen overseas. It saddens me. I would love to see a revamped Stamford Bridge, but as many have said on here, I cannot see a logical way of doing that. If we want a larger capacity venue, we will need to move. As much as I hate the thought of leaving the Bridge, it will eventually be a necessity."
"Local elections next month, if Labour get voted in to LBHF they should should be a little kinder to us than Conservatives as far as expansion/EC goes."
There's only enough square footage around Stamford Bridge to expand the current stadium by about 5 thousand which is not big enough for what the club wants.
That is the biggest disappointment for me too. I can't stand all these property developers who don't even live here but own iconic land such as this but seek to only make second homes for the filthy rich.

I can't stand the thought of more overpriced apartments in London to be honest. Apartments owned by obscenely rich folk sit idle most of the year aswell as they're usually off gallivanting about showing off how wealthy they are.

"It's the same in Manhattan, San Francisco, and Washington D.C.  It's called gentrification. Gentrification leads to lower crime rates. Yeah, rent is gonna rise. It costs more to live in desirable places. Fact of life. London is a very desirable place to live. I guess you would prefer if Roman Abramovich never moved to London?."
"Now when did I say that? Don't put words in my mouth fella. All I said, is there needs to be more diversity and more affordable accomodation. There is already plenty of pricey property in London as is."
It's a statistical fact that gentrification leads to less crime.

Did a few interviews with the two remaining original residents who say that systematically all their neighbors left, as the money on offer became too high to turn down."

"Anyway, apart from Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck; I mention those two famous Americans to show that the best things coming out of America are cartoon characters although that could be said of their current President….a lame duck who is a mouse with no balls…..anyway back on topic, we need at least a 60,000 seater, the local fan base could easily sustain a nearly full house for most games however the seat prices will have to be finely balanced.  I recall the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team having $2 Tuesdays where you could watch a night game, albeit in the nose bleeds, for 2 bucks which is great when you are dragging a few kids around.  So I am sure the boys from the bridge could lower the seat prices quite a bit on a Wednesdays, especially against lower teams.  But the dilemma is finding the enormous amount of land required to build the place, or you knock the existing place down and entirely redesign the existing space with higher level seating, while we play at Wembley while building takes place, well I mean its like a second home to us anyway.."

Basically it's at a stand still.
CPO aren't there to make things difficult be we do intend to ensure we stay close too our routes.
Cheers.
I don't see how much more can be done to the Bridge though?
"The CPO's aren't being difficult for bad reasons, they have genuine concerns about the club were they to sell their pitch ownership back to the club."
a knock and rebuild would probably fulfil alot more hope of getting a 60-70k seater in there.
The only thing I can think is if they were to knock the shed end down including the hotel and mega-store and rebuild that stand as 1 level stand like the kop end at Anfield or what was being proposed for the Battersea stadium.
"The board have made promises about not moving (too far) away from SW6 should they be allowed to buy back from CPO but I think there remains a skepticism which I think is what led to the ""no"" vote a couple of years back."
"I think one of the bones of contention was the board promised not to look at sites further afield than 3 miles from the Bridge, but only until 2020. Which immediately begs the question: what happens after that? I want us to progress but I also want us to stay within our natural territory. No White City, Old Oak, East London etc."
 East London etc.
Basically the CPO's having essentially saved the club from going under hold the clubs interests very dear to their hearts and have a very emotional attachment to Stamford Bridge... I think there remains a belief that more can be done to expand Stamford Bridge's current capacity despite the club insisting otherwise. 
Would it though?
"Before long there's going to be something like 10 teams in England alone that have bigger stadium capacities than ours and with the pressure that FFP brings, especially in regards to what transfer funds we are allowed to spend how long can the club sit on their hands and wait for the idealistic scenario to present itself? "
I think so
When Battersea was discussed there was talk of Chelsea FC contributing millions to the Northern line extension.
The media has noted that it might cost as much as 600mp to enlarge Stamford Bridge. But the biggest obstacle as Fatty Speeding has noted is that Fulham council are not very friendly towards our organization. You can bet top dollar that Abramovich is going to be spending some top dollar on election campaigns in the months ahead to get a friendly seat or two there.
I understand that the costs were partly covered by selling Stamford Bridge Grounds but surely the cost of redeveloping and spending money on emergency exits are viable?
would our capacity be increased at all if safe-standing was introduced?
I would be very surprised if we find a location within three miles of Stamford Bridge in the next five and a half years.
"A right pickle, we need to make people some offers they can't refuse."
Could just bulldoze the cemetary next door  
Battersea would be amazing. It would become an iconic stadium all over europe I think. Hope the club works for that.

Could any of the land surrounding the bridge be purchased? There has to be some option. As mentioned above it would seem sensible for RA to focus on getting the city council in his pocket or at least not actively against us. There are so many building projects that are undertaken against the wishes of local residents I just can't understand how there is absolutely NO option to expand where we are located. Expand the stadium over the rail line with a tunnel going underneath the stand? sh*t there's got to be something lol
"Here's a quick Photoshop I did, which shows just how boxed in we really are. "
double post
Yeah Zola I can't see us doing anything of note with the Bridge.
The green bit you highlighted is Brompton presents like you said they have plenty of money so they won't be bought out.  The red bit has listed buildings so making the exits bigger is not possible.  The main problem is all fans have to exit onto the Fulham road.  Remember when Bates was trying to get planning permission for a walkway towards earls court and for a train platform to be put at Stamford bridge.  Sadly I can't see us expanding the bridge its just seems impossible.
Well sh*t

"Can't we just build up, instead of out?"
Good to see such a good debate on the matter be rekindled.
"Can't we just build up, instead of out?"
I think someone said earlier the stands are already too steep for current regulations.
"I have seen the artist sketch of the Battersea Stadium and I was impressed by the design of it, but I feel like it's still walking away from our traditions and history. Sure having a bigger stadium will generate more profit through ticket sales but at the end of the day Stamford Bridge has been Chelsea's spiritual home for over a century now, since 1905 specifically when the club was first founded. "

"The club is more than that though. At the risk of sounding scouse, a club is also defined by its history. Our history is at Stamford Bridge. Every trophy we've won, every promotion, every relegation, every heartache, every moment of pure joy is etched into those walls. It would be a shame to give all that up, just for the sake of making more money."
That's true but at the end of the day we've seemingly no choice and if we truly want what's best for the club then moving is the only option.  We are not the first and we certainly won't be the last. 
We have to move on as a club. 
It would break my heart if we moved.

"Could there be a possibility of an ""all standing"" end?  Don't Dortmund have one and that stand alone can hold something like 15,000"
"Similarly, if we dont make the move. Like the scouse, we'd be living off our history. Not making it."
"That's just an assumption. I very much doubt FFP will still be a factor 10 years from now, it's already been proven to be bollocks and easy to get around, it's a pointless system that only favours the rich clubs, hardly ""fair"". Anyway, I can't see us being so reliant on extra ticket sales that it would stop us competing."
Also found this bit of information on current site expansion via the journos

"What walls though? The Bridge looks nothing like the place I first went to as a lad, only The East Stand vaguely resembles anything from my past and that was built in '74! All of the other walls you mention have been built in the last 20 years. Not exactly an historic stadium, more like occupying the same patch of ground for 100 + years."
"How many stadiums are the same after 100 years Tony ?  I reckon none.  It's still our home the same road that generation of fans like my dad myself, my nephew and niece and soon my daughter.  We probably won't stay but it will be an emotional time if we moved.  "

"We've made losses amounting to a whopping £  700 million over the last 10 years. Emotions aside, that figure alone is reason enough to get a bigger stadium, else we will fade into mediocrity eventually. "

Do anyone notice that there were some seats left at top of North and south stands during previous games
Any reason behind it
Foe advertising boards that obscure views I think? ?
"It might be safety,  to do with access, with there being only the south entrance/ exit onto Fulham Rd for 40000+ people. It might also be that the media/ TV crews take up a lot of space on CL nights, meaning that access/ evacuation would be more of a problem, so they lower the capacity."
Reduced capacity on Champions League nights. Not sure if it's UEFA or the police who reduce it.
It because the tv trucks behind the mh stand make the space tighter for fans to exit the stadium
Fingers crossed for a Labour LBHF win today.

Wished they increased the seats onto north and south. .seats are low ..double the seats and we are into around 58000
"Expansion or New Stadium has to happen to continue the growth of the club, its simple."
"New pitch being laid at Stamford Bridge including upgrading the under soil heating and drainage system, they're are upgrading the floodlight system too."
"New pitch being laid at Stamford Bridge including upgrading the under soil heating and drainage system, they're are upgrading the floodlight system too."
Also if we were to move then we would stay at the bridge until the new stadium was ready. 
They relay the pitch every year or two anyway I think.
Now that Labour have taken LBHF how does this affect our chances of potentially moving to a new stadium?
National Grid have just submitted a plan to Hammersmith & Fulham to demolish the gas holders just down the road and create a huge cleared site for future development. When flats are going for millions in the area a football stadium isn't really going to get a look in. We've been priced out of the area.
That's sound like perfect plan...build new stadium and make Stamford Bridge a training ground or some form of venue
Now that Labour have taken LBHF how does this affect our chances of potentially moving to a new stadium?
"If no plans are announced, then its 10 years before anything happens."
New Labour council take first steps against the current Earls Court plan
Wonder what they are doing to the floodlight system? Its not like the Bridge ever looks dim?   
"Roman needs to make a big bung (not suggesting illegality just whatever that looks like to get some action) to the council and get some favorable planning permission, or find a way to compensate lease holders on the site to make them go away and demo some of Bates non football stadium space"
"New post on CFC Truth today, always worth a read if you're interested in the new stadium stuff."
"Roman needs to make a big bung (not suggesting illegality just whatever that looks like to get some action) to the council and get some favorable planning permission, or find a way to compensate lease holders on the site to make them go away and demo some of Bates non football stadium space"
I think with the fan base growing each year we would fill it. Also if we had a bigger ground then other gigs come up which we would make money off such as music events or boxing matches or even if we were to get a world cup or euro cup. 
"For the past decade we've relied a lot on Roman's heavy investment for our success -- he won't be here forever and will probably eventually look to sell. Then what? There's no guarantee we'll have a multi multi billionaire take us over to be able to continue this investment, nor should we be relying on that really. Thus, a sustainable method, which may hamper short-term success would assist us in the long run by generating greater revenues from tickets, not limited to just Chelsea matches but others too. "
I am pinning my hopes on Roman never leaving :)
Im pinning my hopes on him leaving all his money and the club to his son and his son splashes every penny on our club. 
"Even if Roman or his son or his great great grandson one day sell the club, think how rich the next bloke would have to be to buy it, and given our prestige and our location I don't doubt there'd be suitors lining around the corner."
Not underestimating the importance of a stadium and meeting fans' needs but from a financial point of view doesn't most of the money come from world wide TV rights these days?
Wonder if Chelsea FC are putting forward any representation on crossrail 2 and discussions on Station.
"The most disappointing aspect to all this, is that it may have in fact been us the fans, or rather a minority of them, who were and have been responsible for us missing out on the one suitable, in fantastic alternate site - ie Battersea"

It was all about bribes and corruption.Chelsea would never have got it.
On one hand I do understand part of the reason why the CPO said no to start with but on the other hand i totally agree that because of that it delayed us so much that we missed out. 
"Agreed, the new stadium should be underway already, the clock is ticking and others are getting it done. We have to find a solution and quickly. "
The main reason the CPO said no was because the club weren't up front with us - if the offer had been to give up the shares and the club will move within 3 miles of the Bridge I think the vote would have been yes.
"The CPO held us back in the end it seems, but hey had good intentions"
"It may have been once the banks foreclosed, but if Roman had been able to negotiate a private sale, there is a very good chance the new stadium build at battersea would now be underway"
"Come on, the club handled the situation woefully so only have themselves to blame...talked to the press before the fans, a mysterious 'won't move beyond three miles before 2020' and buying up shares themselves...if it had been a sell shares cos we're moving to a specific site like earls court or battersea, then they probably would have won...but it was all so shady and such a sensitive issue, no wonder it ended with a no vote"
it was never ours to lose.
it was never ours to lose.
"If we leave the bridge then that's me done. If we get a 55,000 stadium it will mean an extra 13,000 middle class tosspots who are willing to pay top dollar just to sit there motionless and applaud politely for ninety minutes."
The main reason the CPO said no was because the club weren't up front with us - if the offer had been to give up the shares and the club will move within 3 miles of the Bridge I think the vote would have been yes.
"Exciting potential news...chelsea looking into redeveloping Stamford bridge...looking into all the ares around the ground etc..early days and no promises made, but hope springs eternal"

Good news.
If he pulls this off Roman will have won me over and I'll gladly offer myself to him!
"Best possible option since day one in my mind, mind you Battersea Stadium would of looked amazing."
"I recall a while back the club put up an article explaining in detail why Stamford Bridge couldn't be expanded. I wonder if this change is related to Labour winning control of Hammersmith and Fulham as, supposedly, they're a bit more favourable to us than the Tories are."
"Your spot on mate, to be honest I was going to reply but after feeling like ive had to defend myself & other CPO holders over & over on various forums I couldn't be arsed."
"Call it tosh if you like but one of the biggest reasons why a number of fans just like me and my dad decided to vote no was because the moment Bruce Buck sat on Chelsea TV and said he bought the maximum number of shares possible was because he'd always loved Chelsea, was the moment I stopped trusting a word he uttered on the subject. I didn't expect the club to tell us details of what they were proposing but equally they didn't need to add the 3 mile radius time limit either."
Here's another article about the redevelopment
"I had a dream that we redevelop SB with 30 degree stands and rail seating.60'000 packed around the ground, right on top of the action.Massive tifo all round with banners of Ossie, Zola, Drogba and other past legends.Maybe one day aye ?"
.
You were looking for excuses not to have to leave the only Chelsea home we've known. Understandable but you cannot say the no vote was in the best interests of Chelsea - that much should be very clear at this point.
"Let me set one thing straight, I voted Yes. That said it was a bloody tough decision and done with massive reservations, my posts have been to try and explain why so many voted no. And with damned good reason. Those suggesting they were wrong to do so obviously don't fully understand how close we came to losing the club and why CPO shareholders deserve some respect."
"And while respecting anyone that voted yes barn, those that voted no should also be respected for not wanting to abandon our historical home on a whim and a prayer...I appreciate the need for a bigger stadium to compete and cope with ffp, but people seem to forget the soulless venues that can be created in its place...arsenal have had a pretty ground for eight-nine years, but it is about as intimidating as an oj and lemonade..."
"Don't think you can blame any side, everyone who voted did so for the best in their minds."

"I think it's been announced to let us know they are looking into it, nothing more."
Good reaction piece on the statement by CFCTruth:
"I didn't vote or nothin' but if I did, it would be a no."
"I love our stadium the way it is. If we do increase it to a 60,000 capacity it would be soulless, like the Emirates Stadium or the Etihad."
"Our ground is pretty souless anyway, it's not the building or the site that causes that. It's the people within."
"Our ground is pretty souless anyway, it's not the building or the site that causes that. It's the people within."
"Even though its quiet now, 20,000 more people will inevitably make it louder!"
"Yes..reading the above comments on the people within that have made the BRIDGE soul less...I agree......The Bridge in actual fact is a great looking place...We know noise CAN be generated because 8 out of 10 times the away fans do so.......There are many many goodl little mobs of Blues STILL ABOUT...( but) unfortunately theyre spread too thinly for my liking  around the ground.......Too many strangers sitting next to each other either not wanting to make noise , or, being a bit coy.......If and when the new gaff comes bout CFC must ready one big end (min) with applicants that wanna do nothing but create noise noise noise....Its worth a few more points a season ...."

"Is it utterly cynical of me to to suggest this is just simple PR from the club ? They know full well we cant redevelop but are just trying to prove that its actually what they really want to do, before ploughing ahead with moving from SB ?"
Oh and i see Bruce Buck has got a login now
Does ground redevelopment have any implications on ffp?

The Italian league is sh*t though and attendances are awful. 
"^ Juve sell out most weeks, they have a strong team, and are in the top 10 in Deloitte's money league. They aren't doing too badly with a smaller stadium than SB."
"you've often mentioned juventus, but what about the 20 other big clubs who all have big stadiums or are looking to get bigger ones? "
"Facts are IF we don't expand either at the bridge or a new stadium, theres only one outcome massive increase in ticket prices. Because of the ffp RA can't bank roll us anymore, the club are working hard on off the pitch income but if we want to stay at the top, employing the best players, and attracting the best transfers in, wheres the money going to come from,"
RA can bankroll us and he can invest into the club. For example the stadium or expansion will be financed by him. Buying players the way we have done in the past is probably behind us.

Lol. .found this on Facebook ...would be amazing if we can get 70k from Stamford Bridge
"We don't need to convert stamford bridge into a huge stadium. I think 50,000-60,000 would be ideal as we still want it to have that enclosed, intimidation factor to it."

As I said earlier I agree that we may have to move particularly if we want to continue to compete against other top clubs.
55-60k would be ideal.
"Will we really fill a 60,000 seater stadium out at our prices I really doubt it."
55-60k would be ideal.
"if it opens it up for people to choose nearer the date of the game if they want to go then I think we'll stand a much better chance of filling it.  Another way to increase attendance is to sell people a ticket in a stand rather than a specific seat, that will allow people to sit with their mates."
"We don't need to convert stamford bridge into a huge stadium. I think 50,000-60,000 would be ideal as we still want it to have that enclosed, intimidation factor to it."

It's fine for what I require.

Some of the CPO members i know are more worried about having to travel a little bit longer than the future of the club. Some of them get a 10 minute bus to the ground. It takes me nearly two hours. I think some of them are more worried about travel time than they are about the actual future of our club. 
LDS to look at Chelsea capacity
Good I hope we stay. Keep some of the clubs identity. How any true supporter could want to move is beyond me. 
"the CPO have long been protecting the interests of Chelsea and Stamford Bridge. i trust those members to do what is right, as loyal, long-standing supporters. if they felt there wasnt a strong enough case for moving, or that the proposal wasnt good enough then i trust them in that decision. Its one of the few occassions where fans get a voice in important matters at our football club, and we should back those fans 100%. God knows enough of us moan when we dont get a say in what goes on, so why criticise those who stand up for us when they are allowed a vote? (Not a dig at you personally enders, just a general point!)"

"Well this is a first for me trying to hold down the bile and not punching my laptop. This is so wrong so f**king wrong look at that i honestly can't believe that a Chelsea fan would want us to move to this. To all old Shed boys hand on heart what's Chelsea all about  6,000 at home to Orient or a 55.000 stadium full of Jeremy's and Prunellas"
"Take your point mate but times have changed. Football is so radically different now to what it was back in your day. The reality is that, for Chelsea to keep up with the other top clubs in the world, we need a bigger ground."
"Yes your right but it's not for me. I just can't watch Chelsea anywhere but the bridge. I have real doubts that a 55,000 plus stadium will be the massive success a lot of people think it will be."
When you got the atmosphere generated by the West Stand and Gate 13 of the East Stand especially in the mid 80s Chelsea was a really intimidating place. All our firm used to sit at away games the first i saw them do that was at Orient in 1981. What i'm saying is sitting was never the problem for most Chelsea fans and we were the first fans to do this certainly in London and i can only think off the top of my head Leeds in 1983 where there most vociferous fans where in the seats behind the goal. A new stadium will bring with it eye watering ticket prices which is going to out price swathes of our support. Don't forget our crowds weren't great when cup games and Champions League tickets were full price.
"Yes was at Leeds 83/84 in the seats at the side, we had about 8-9000 that day. I must admit from being on benches of gate 13 I would always try and get seats rather than stand away. If the ground was bigger, I can't see the need to charge more as the extra revenue would come from extra seats."

"Arsenal's prices have risen & they have an extra 25,000 tickets to sell, anyone who thinks Chelsea & most clubs wont fleece their fans for more money when they move to a bigger ground is deluded, lets see how much WHU charge home & away fans when they move, bet it'll be £60+."
Your right there is no need to charge more but i still think they would. For arguements sake let's say we moved in 10 years how much would the cheapest ticket for a Cat AA game be?. The average fan is priced out as it is and i just can't see who will be able to afford those prices with family commitments etc coming first on the list of peoples priorities.

Boxes it's all about the boxes ..........more boxes match day for club massive pay day!!
There were guys with high visibility vests and hard hats down the Fulham Road today and what looked liked suited and booted toward the Cemetry after viewing the East Stand. Looks certain they are looking at a bridge over the railway line or maybe a new stop ? Knocking down the east and starting afresh making the upper tier of the Mathew Harding higher.

"another thing to keep in mind is that if a tourist is in London and wants to go to a game, if they can get a ticket to Chelsea they take that memory and spend money on the club for ever more in terms of kits etc, they also have children and extended family that also then have a reason to support Chelsea over anyone else - the knock on keeps going."
I was thinking about this the other day and to be honest we dont need to fill it every game. What ever we get over what we get currently is a plus and means more money for the club.

"Oh course im not happy with it BUT that is just the way of big clubs now days. The club want money. We as fans are replaceable. For every one fan who says ""Im sick of this, I will go and watch Bromley FC instead"" there will be another 10 fans (at least) wanting to take your ticket."

"One of the things I miss about the 70s, 80s and 90s - before football became so massive, before we became so successful - is the ability just to turn up, pay on the gate and watch a game. I'd love the freedom to be able to do that again. If we did have a 60000 capacity stadium, there'd be a chance of at least some games not being all-ticket."

Did he mention that Audi and Adidas own almost 20% of the club between them?

I would love to stay as well but if it's the best thing for the club then I would back it. I remember when it was going all seater and people were saying can't go to the ground when it's all seated. People came round to it. Let's face it the Shed on big games is half occupied by AWAY fans!!! I wouldn't have thought that when I walked up those steps to the side of the white wall in 1978. Maybe there should be plans if we do move to make sure like minded people have an area to be together and get some old fashioned atmosphere back.
"Stamford Bridge is not what it was, as you say the shed is now a tiny little stand half occupied by away fans!"
"Like Arsenal did, you mean?"
"Anyone who thinks a new stadium will result in lower ticket prices is extremely naive IMO. The stadium will have to be paid for and, after all, the whole point is to make a lot more money."

"We wouldn't fill a 60k stadium, week in, week out with current ticket prices."
"Two things to think about is a friend of mine had a season ticket in the old Directors area in the East Stand Middle tier. He was paying just over £8000 five years ago, which included every home game including cup games and a 3 course meal. If the club increase those areas for FFP and make their money, let them bleed those kind of people and keep our prices reasonable. Also the sale if we have to move is the Sq ft of site is so expensive, and salvage of metal etc would fund new site considerably."
If we had the right stadium with the right pricing we'd fill a 70k stadium
"We also got to realise that we need new fans coming through. Fans from 60s 70s ( myself) 80s and 90s aren't going to fill stamford bridge. We may think we're more passionate or vocal, but we want new blood coming through and I know people who use the family section to get their kids coming to the games to keep the tradition going. They can't be all labelled ""plastic"".    My first game as 9 year old was Chelsea vs Liverpool 1978 over 45,000  then went for the rest of that season with nowhere near that figure, so we had plastic fans back then."
The increased capacity re the corporate side would easily subidise the cheaper seats to ensure capacity crowds
And your happy with this?. A football club where it's core support are tourists. And you wonder why other fans take the piss out of us and call us plastic. I just couldn't step foot in a place like that it's almost anti-football fan. It's a marketing man's wet dream and a football fan's nightmare

Quick question. I've been to the Bridge like 6 times and was on wikipedia today ans saw they had 85k for a match in the 30's . I know the stadium was remodeled a few years ago but I can't see how they could have crammed that many people into a stadium with that small of a footprint
"It was no seating back then, just all open space, picture it as a greyhound track, fans all around it."

I love Stamford Bridge. I cant imagine Chelsea having a home match in another stadium. I hope we expand the capacity instead of moving. 
"I don't know about the geology bellow SB, but has there been any discussion on engineering an underground parking/shops/space/etc? I do really like the idea of the steep stands to be ""on top"" of the game. Could they also lower the level of the pitch as well to add to that affect? Just throwing these ideas out there, not really sure how feasible it would be. Also possibly looking into building parking ramps like the ones found in Chicago, USA that when empty appear as giant sculptures..."
Think someone mentioned the water table below Stamford Bridge had to be taken into consideration.
Water table is supposed to be to high however we have an underground car park under the new shed area.

"We likely will have to play somewhere else while expanding, so we will probably have home matches somewhere else for awhile."
It would be such a shame if we had to move elsewhere. But we do need a bigger stadium to compete with other big clubs. 
It sounds like that the issue of standing is being pushed by the government with the lib dems now backing sage standing areas.

"I would certainly love to see more seating available to both improve ease of getting tickets to big matches and of course improve revenue for FFP reasons.  But as a guy in the Boston area I've lived the 'replace' or 'invest in the old place' debate for many years due to my city's baseball stadium for the Red Sox, Fenway Park (1912).  There are many parallels...  and the owners of the sox (owners of the scousers, BTW) kept the cherished old place and no one has looked back.  I certainly hope the fate of the bridge is the same, improvement, enlargement but ultimately not replacement.  I attended my first match there last Spring and it was magical.  I've been to the etihad, and to wembley.  And damn the new wembley is a cool place, but you know I like Stamford Bridge the best of the lot (etihad completely sucks and is a boring utilitarian charmless place IMO).  Stamford Bridge isn't at a fenway park level for me, but it's a place with a soul.  Just my 2 cents."
I love Fenway and as a Yankees fan think what they did was awesome compared to us.  We knocked down the House that Ruth Built for some concrete gray and navy blue sterile environment that simply caters to the wealthy.  Before a fan could go down to the field prior to games.  Not anymore though because the Yankees don't want to pass off the people who paid ridiculous money to let's face it a subpar team.  
"I just wish we would find some kind of solution to the problem, I feel like we could well get left"
"I love the fact that we play in such a nice part of London, but in some ways that very fact makes it that much harder to find a suitable site to move to (if we had to). Areas like Seven Sisters etc are such sh*tholes that it's not difficult to find a spot for a stadium."
Do we know when the new Chelsea Stamford Bridge expansion study is due?
"Here's a way to fit more people in Stamford Bridge. Everyone only thinks of housing fans to the side of the pitch ie the stands. Why not utilise the space above the pitch- what you do is have a system of suspended wires, lets say 40 yards up. Hanging upside down from these wires are Chelsea fans, packed shoulder to shoulder, like a load of bats, looking down on the match below. They might find it a pain in the arse getting a beer at half time, and the blood will no doubt rush to their head after 90 minutes of being suspended upside down, but if it means we can squeeze a few more thousand in its a price worth paying"
^^^^^
"Or do a swap with with West Brompton boneyard next door. Dig up all the stiffs, re- bury them at SB, and we build a new stadium on their land 50 yards away. Ps you may or may not know that that graveyard is a favourite destination for the, Earls Court cruising community shall we say. Go to the top of the East Stand during night games, and look out that long window, and you can see them going at it on top of the tombstones. Nice"
I presume we cannot increase capacity like they did at the Stade de France by digging down?
"I thought the problem with increasing our size wasn't how we would do it, I thought it was getting the fans in and out of the stadium safely due to our location?"
"I thought the problem with increasing our size wasn't how we would do it, I thought it was getting the fans in and out of the stadium safely due to our location?"

Pinched from The Sunday Times. Chelsea are allegedly in negotiations with the RFU to play at Twickenham for a year. 
82000 for a season would be brilliant!  And it's where I'm from so I'm probably biased when I say I'd love to play at Twickenham.  Not permanently though. I want us to stay at the Bridge. 
I know it's early days.  But that sounds like it has wheels and is extremely exciting! !
Certainly exciting be great if the club done some sort of cheap to tickets especially for families and youths try get back the generations of fans we priced out and with a huge stadium like that it might happen. I know its only a year but we could give youth a chance to watch us cheaply they might get hooked.  We have quite an old fan bass I reckon

I think I may be visiting her rather more often!  
The local infra-structure is there too as they're used to coping with large crowds for the big rugby games.  Pubs and restaurants too I guess.  Though I remember as a teenager hating the rugby as some of the pubs used to close rather than want the fans in!  The whole area has gone much more upmarket now - could be interesting!
Random story considering I just applied for about a grand's worth of tickets there for the Rugby World Cup.
Ah the Barmy Arms!   Many hours of misspent youth in there!  But it's tiny inside.

Twickenham would be awful but could grin and bear anything for one season if it meant not leaving the bridge
Really don't think we need to extend the Bridge. knee jerk reaction from the club after Tottenham and Liverpool extending/changing their stadiums.

"Can't see cheap tickets happening for families and youths. That's what arsenal fans were expecting and the oppsite happened and instead the ticket prices rocketed. The extra 10,000 will then probably come from Japenese tourists and co-operations handing out tickets to their employees. No thanks."
Really don't think we need to extend the Bridge. knee jerk reaction from the club after Tottenham and Liverpool extending/changing their stadiums.
It's hard not to have a kneejerk reaction to seeing Arsenal make €34 million per season in matchday revenue than us. (2010 figures).

So what specifically do the club think they can do to expand the size of the bridge? Where do they intend on building? Knocking down the Matthew Harding and/or East stand and completely rebuilding them or can they somehow expand them without knocking anything down?

Its funny really when the west stand was opened against Newcastle in 2001 the bridge was finally complete but now we could be doing it all again.

"it will have to be a large expansion to justify cost, realistically the shed, east, and mhl, need to be knocked down,along with both hotels,that way it could be built with the turnstiles incorporated into covered walk ways, similar to the east stand but larger then the foundations can be moved back, making larger stands, they can also seek permission for standing areas like in germany."

"IF this comes off, with the extra capacity making tickets easier to get hold of, I might actually manage to make it to the occasional game. It would be nice if the extra capacity was reflected in lower ticket prices, but with the redevelopment to pay for, that's something we can't rely on."
"In principle the Twickenham idea isn't a bad one at all in my book. Having lost out on Battersea I really want us to stay at the Bridge, if the club were to relocate to some dump like Kensal Rise I'd be livid. If we have to play at the home of Rugby for one season in order to stay at the Bridge then so be it. Twickenham isn't too far at all from me either so no disaster in terms of travel. "

The big difference for west ham is that they know and accept that in the short term they have to provide cheap tickets in the hope that they generate a new generation of fans.
The Standard now saying we are considering Wembley. Its basically our second stadium anyway ;)
So the plan is to expand SB? I think 55-60k is maximum. Would be kind of interesting to see how full we would get this 82k rugbystadium...
I wonder how the club plan to upgrade the bridge to 60k? Also how do they plan to do it within a year.
The Standard now saying we are considering Wembley. Its basically our second stadium anyway ;)
Not sure what we could do to get another 18 odd thousand seats in but I suppose that's for others to work on. 
I read somewhere once that we would increase the capacity to 60k but only 6000 of them seats would me made available to 'regular fans' the rest would be hospitality. As with the emirates they have concreted massively on corporate seating. It's where the money is after all. Don't agree with it but its fact. 
The fact that the club are looking at temporary venues may be a good thing.
 
"I'm sure I read years ago that as part of the agreement between the RFU and Richmond Borough Council that Twickenham could only be used for a certain number of events each year. I don't know how many times a year Twickenham is used at the moment but having 19 football matches could result in a few complaints from the locals. Hope not given the extra revenue the local pubs, cafes etc will make."

My first post so please be gentle.
I'd still rather a little less revenue than a bowl with no atmosphere like the Emirates.
"I think the club (or some companies on the club's behalf) are only doing a feasibility study. Checking whether a temporary move is possible, where and how much it would cost while SB is redeveloped has to be part of any serious such paper. It doesn't necessarily mean that it will happen or even that the club is considering it."

"I'm sure I read years ago that as part of the agreement between the RFU and Richmond Borough Council that Twickenham could only be used for a certain number of events each year. I don't know how many times a year Twickenham is used at the moment but having 19 football matches could result in a few complaints from the locals. Hope not given the extra revenue the local pubs, cafes etc will make."
You're right about the limit on the number of events Twickenham can host I think but I've no idea what the number is. And it's not going to be a few residents complaining but almost all of them - they won't care about extra business. And they'll be mainly eloquent middle class types who know how to get their voices heard.
"They won't be happy with anything!!  To be fair, it would be major disruption every other week.  The main road from Central London and Richmond is shut every time there's a game at Twickenham because that's the way the fans have to walk from the station.  And that of course would be the road that would need to be shut towards the end of rush hour for midweek games - a main commuter route.  "

I think our second home would be a better option! The FA still owe sh*t loads of money so us renting it for a season or two could help them out. 
"As Undertow said, I think these discussions have to be had as part of the feasability study and it's nothing more than that at this stage.  I wouldn't worry too much about if it's going to be Wembley or Twickers just yet, or the logistics of it, far more likely that they're getting an initial answer to the question; ""is it something you would discuss?"" rather than a firm plan or agreement."
"Sorry but playing at Wembley should be a special occasion, I wouldn't want us to play there for a season it would totally ruin any magic of playing a cup final there."
Or it would be a boost psychologically for the players in future finals ?
I think it would give us the home field advantage! 
"Sorry but playing at Wembley should be a special occasion, I wouldn't want us to play there for a season it would totally ruin any magic of playing a cup final there."
"Sorry I just do not agree with playing domestic games at our national stadium, whether or not you think the 'magic' has gone."
If it means we can extend our stadium we should play there. Who cares really.
I wrote to the Bridge officialdom moons ago and put forward the following poss plan for our own 15000 cap end at the shed...This was b4 it was mentioned for battersea...I said it would be poss to re build the shed from INSIDE and upwards...A sort of style the villa end is......There is 7000 extra in one fell swoop.....AND i want a seat bang in the middle please

"Why can't we put the away fans in the upper tear of the east stand towards 1 side. Most teams put the away fans in the worst section these days e.g Newcastle, Sunderland, villa, and palace. Didn't we have a spell at putting the away fans in the west stand while it was being built? Got a feeling we played man ure in the cup and we shared the west with them and afterwards it was a nightmare walking back to the tube etc. police wouldn't allow it now. While we are on this why do we insist on giving the away allocation 3,000 seats? I seem to think the fa rules state the home team have to allocate 5% of the stadium to the away team as long as it is safe. We should move the segregation along a bit and give the away teams 2,000. We only get 3,000 at old Trafford!!!!"

The station is one side of it and the stadium the other.  I don't really know how else they could do it - other than building a footbridge over it I suppose.

"There was a bit more to it than that. He was granted a licence for 3 nights (as expected) but not 5 and for some reason Brooks  pulled out completey to the bewilderment of everyone, taking a 'all or nothing' stance. Whole thing over there was farcically organised anyway (and not for the first time at that venue), with the tickets going on sale without even a preliminary discussion over licenses."
Yes Brooks played his part in making it awkward by being greedy and demanding all 5. The promotor jas a lot to answer for as well by just assuming it woukd be ok. The fact is however if the residents didn't  give off so much it would have went ahead as planned.
It was a farce indeed. I didn't care particularly as I'm not a fan of country music at all 
"It seems,so the tv pundit mentioned, that chelsea LOOK LIKELY to build on stamford bridge site , making 3 stands bigger...Cool"
So anyone any ideas of plans? Will west stand be the only stand not changing?

"Might as well kill this one now before we all start building our expectations. The neighbours won't allow it, the local authorities won't allow it, and crucially the RFU would never approve of it in a million years- they despise the round ball and all it stands for. It's no coincidence that to my knowledge not a single minute of associated football has ever taken place at Twickenham. There's more chance of Dagenham and Redbrige winning the Champions League than us setting foot in the place"

Not directly topic related but I found this article on the Dortmund way interesting. 
They are entitled put yourself in the position of the residents.  Anyway its a bit cheeky selling tickets for a gig that hasn't got the go ahead.  All in all the whole think was a shambles could only happen in Ireland

"But its current capacity of less than 42,000 contributes to the fact that it earns £1.5m a match – or £35m a season – less than London rivals Arsenal in terms of matchday revenue."
"The irritating thing is, the Manchester clubs have it easy as there's plenty land space for them to build on, whereas for us, being london (especially west london) based is extremely hard to find these areas without them being bought up by wealthy investors. I guess it's the con to being london based, but it's mightily frustrating. "
At least our players want to live in their city.

That's one hell of a job if was true

"Yeah that's why we'd have to move out for a while, not sure how feasible it is to be honest, demolition alone would be a massive task i'd imagine, the design would have to be done then the re-building & thats only if they got planning permission first."
Surely the clubs best bets now is to pretty much pull the whole stadium down and start again. 
60K would be one hell of a job! It would be a tough task trying to get out of the bridge after a game. Surely the club must be looking at making another exit.
They should get rid of the hotel. It looks like our very own piece of Milton Keynes in SW6.
"Word is the MH/East & Shed to be knocked down, so my mate has heard."
I read an article saying that expanding SB was next to impossible given the safety and evacuation requirements. Apparently the exits aren't wide enough for an expanded amount of people and contructing new avenues for that would be insanely costly. Of course expanding would be the best option but I think this will have to be a rebuild. Battersea would have been awesome to move to but alas.
Went past Battersea Power Station yesterday. Safe to say that ship has well sailed. Looks like they're taking the chimneys down brick by brick !!!!
Is 60k even enough in the scale of our long term ambition to be the biggest club in the world?
Is 60k even enough in the scale of our long term ambition to be the biggest club in the world?
Not gonna lie I think we'd struggle to sell out 60k. For Premier League games I think we might just about fill out the ground but for CL group games and other cup games there'd be so many empty seats. 
Your bang on.
I wouldn't want a situation like Man City where the entire Upper Tier is empty for Cup games. That would just be embarrassing.
"loads of clubs have had their stadiums re built and capacity expanded whilst still playing there! Bristol city are completely re building 3 of 4 stands and re designing the entrances for larger crowds etc and all the houses etc arent affected and also haven't moved also wolves did it to name but two, ok smaller scale but I'm certain SB could be made 50k-60k+refurbed and not need to play elsewhere!"

Just not enough space having the bulldozers in and trying to play games and protect the match goers.  Look at the history of the bridge development from say 95 to 2001 we always had a reduced capacity.  It would just be a health and safety nightmare 
"To be honest, as long as real madrid and Barcelona are around, we will not be the biggest club in the world. I guess you could even add man utd to that list, but I think utd will become a less desirable club for many big players in the future as other clubs, including us, get bigger. "
"If we are going to spend a complete fortune staying at Stamford Bridge adding 20,000 should be the goal if at all possible.. 10 or 15 may not really be worth it ?"
I just don't think we have the space in and around the stadium to make it a 60k odd stadium.
I think it is possible to make the bridge a bit bigger but from the clubs point of view they didnt see the point because of the money it would cost to only get in a few more seats (I know its more than a few). 
"we are not going to move, we are going to redevelop the bridge, c.p.o own the naming rights to chelsea football club and the only places they were in favour of moving to, were battersea and earls court and them birdies have flown,, so we will have to see how many they can squeeze into the bridge there is loads of space, if they knock down the hotels and buy some of the property at the back of the old shed wall,  i don't think we would have trouble selling 60,000 seats, west ham sold out today in less than 3 hours minus season tickets."

Intriguing Stamford Bridge Development article (longish) from the Independent:
Pretty much summing up what we all already know. I am fed up of hearing about the stadium relocation now; we just need to something about it ASAP! Why oh why does the SW post code have to be such a bloody nuisance! I blame the foreigners  
 
"Having been to St James park yesterday, they seem to have similar exit situations as us, but they have a 55000 capacity,  so perhaps to much is made of this?"
Errrrrr...... we're at home.
We should've gone all out for the battersea bid. That's where the battle was lost. What a force we would've been playing at home in an iconic part of London.

"I saw that reported yesterday and the title of the article was ""Chelsea finally agree stadium deal after lengthy talks"" and i got excited, until i saw it was a stadium bought for the youth. It is a great, though, at least the academy has a stadium of it's own, and this seems to be a sign that we are serious about developing our youth. "
Just had a look at Google maps to check out the footprint of the Kingstonian ground. There appears to be a lot of surrounding land (except the graveyards) nearby. Could this be a pre cursor for a new stadium and a move away from Stamford Bridge. There is a South West station nearby (Berrylands) which would have to be totally redeveloped. It seems strange we want the youth teams to play away from Cobham. Can't really see big attendances on a week by week basis.
Looks like we're getting more serious with a study on exit pathways and now this. I get the feeling that any solution at the current site will be innovative which tends to lead to distinctive design choices. Exciting times ahead.
Thats good news
Maybe H&F council have finally budged a bit and allowed us to do some works that were previously blocked?

f**king Bates and his Village project. The only good thing about the hotel is the toilet on matchdays.

Not only just the logistics of match day fans leaving as normal but more importantly emergency evacuation.
The really annoying thing is Colin Hutchinson reckoned we had permission for an extra 6000 seats in the Shed back when it was all re-developed. Instead of that we went for the Village.
So you're the f**kers blocking my way to the bar. Nice pub that one but been frequenting the Prince of Wales of late because it's easier to get served most weeks. Still their takings on matchdays must make up a lot of their business and they'd be loathe to lose us.
"I find Lloyds incredibly soulless considering how many people are in there, no atmosphere at all.  Brogans has singing and good ale but is quite expensive.  Does the Goose have decent beer and singing?  Might give it a try if it does."

The Goose normally has four or five ales. A few lagers as well. Some of the ales are about £3 a pint - not bad for that part of London. Singing on occasions.
Anything to stay at Stamford Bridge would make me ecstatic! It's the heart and soul of our football club!

Not to rehash the past but it isn't. Hopefully the club find a workaround that enables us to stay at the bridge but there was another option.
"At the time & the way Chelsea had acted with their underhand tactics it was, end of the day us CPO were protecting Stamford Bridge just like we were when we bought our shares, if Chelsea had acted differently & had concrete plans in place we'd have all voted Yes."
"Again, rehashing old arguments is pointless but I thought it showed a tremendous lack of faith in a man who had done so much for this club and I say that as a CPO shareholder with family who also have them. When you look at where we were under Bates, it's arguable that Roman saved us from going down the same route as Leeds yet people didn't trust him."

"/\superb post. You've highlighted the issues associated with Roman that I alluded to, albeit not as well as you have. A significant amount of land and property in London is now Russian owned, so it will be interesting to see what happens."
This was not too long after he went against 99.9% of Chelsea fans wishes and sacked club legend Di Matteo and installed Chelsea fans hate figure Rafael Benitez on the basis of what was deemed best for the club and in turn the fans.
"6 months after a CL win, 5 months after signing Eden Hazard, 5 months before a Europa League win and 6 months before reappointing Jose. Almost like he's a successful businessman with a long-term plan."
Talk about missing the point.

"That vote really did come down to trust and faith in the current owner and board (well for me at least).  As I've said on here many times I voted in favour of giving up my share to the board but it was a really really tough decision.  They were far too sneaky in the way they were dealing with the whole thing, things like Bruce Buck buying the maximum number of shares just before the vote and claiming it was because he's a life long Chelsea fan being the highlight for me."
 
None of this is relevant to this thread to be fair but I can't stand people who still go along with the media driven story that Benitez came in and 'saved us'. 
"Agreed with all your post but especially this bit.  We were appalling under him - and yes, I admit, made more so by who he was.  He would have had to do a hell of a lot to be accepted but even allowing for my dislike and prejudice, he came nowhere near.  He was not a success.  Remember QPR."

"Not to mention the fact that we f*cked up the Capital One Cup when we were easily the best team left in it, and the Club World Cup when we were easily the best team to enter that too. Yes, the players deserve blame too, but Benitez's lack of motivational skills and dumb substitutions clearly were a factor too."

"^ I'd still say we're much closer to Arsenal than West Ham though regarding what would happen at a new ground. Clubs will generally charge as much as they can get away with and still fill the stadium. West Ham have an additional 30,000 seats to fill and probably don't have the fanbase to fill them. They also have the added advantage of a brand new stadium they didn't have to pay for, so they can afford to be more generous."

"When is this going to start? We keep hearing talk, but no solid date. The last thing I heard was we had consulted the designers of the allianz arena to help design the bridge."
"Two years away from the Bridge but a 60,000 seater stadium at the end of it. Gonna be very strange but good in the long run, and have no problem going to Twickenham for 1 or 2 seasons."
"Also remain very skeptical, this has been chipped away at for years with no real confirmation of the ability to extend in a financially sound way. "
I remain slightly skeptical because I thought previously architects had said there simple isn't enough acres of land available to build a 60k stadium on the existing site.
I think the space issue is going to necessitate a unique stadium design which is fine by me. The other issue has always been egress from the ground which is also part of the study. I reckon that one thing we'll definitely see is naming rights being sold though.
"I always thought space wasn't the problem but more the lack of space and exits to evacuate the ground into, I presume they now have a way round this. But whatever it takes to keep the club at the Bridge is ok by me."

"Still think the whole thing will be a massively difficult undertaking. It's not just 4 stands and a pitch that's going to be demolished, but you have to assume the hotel and flats will go too and there will be a loss in earnings from the facilities, restaurants and associated businesses."
"If this were to happen, if Roman is gonna invest this vast amount of money will he want full rights to the ground? What way would this stand with CPO"
a big pitch would help us i think. give eden hazard an extra 5-10 yards of space down the sides and he'll be an even bigger threat. plus it gives fabregas more space to play the passes into and stretch play
"If this were to happen, if Roman is gonna invest this vast amount of money will he want full rights to the ground? What way would this stand with CPO"
"I wonder if the underground car park is a problem for demolition and construction. Is the roof strong enough for what is needed to replace the current stands. On the restaurant and hotels, sure I read that once the up keep, staff, and other costs, doesn't make that much money. With bars being used during the week like in the Matthew Harding for corporate use, plus the extra match revenue, hopefully the outlay is less but the earnings are greater."
"I really dont see all stands being knocked down, the east and west are big enough, and to knock them all down would be mega expensive. Also dont see it being possible to complete in a couple of years. They would have to make adjustments to the cornering to connect it all, though."

Convinced me! Who knows ha
That assumes that the proposed new ground would be directly built where the current one stands. 
"Perhaps the Aviva stadium in Dublin is something we've been looking at. On a similar sized site to ours and hemmed in like us, next to a railway line too, but they managed to squeeze it in."

"The space needed below ground for any building is the key, not so much above ground. A traditional foundation spreads the force from the building downwards at 45 degrees, so if its near something it may undermine the other buildings around it. Modern engineering has ways round this, obviously but its still something needed taken into account."

"I don't think there's anyway the East Stand isn't redeveloped because it certainly needs it, but we'll also look to maximise the number of hospitality suites we can get in. I know it's not the most popular thing but it's a modern day necessity."

Knock all the stands down....build a box like structure around the pitch...paint a mural depicting thousands of fans all along the in sides of the box like what arsenal did years ago for the north bank...install speakers..pipe in a large crowd soundtrack......charge everyone £20 or so PPV.
I don't like the look of the aviva or Allianz arena at all. The one cool feature they have is that they make it red on match days but in terms of looks I find it awful. 
"I'm sure there are plenty of architect tricks of the trade for maximising use of space, if anything I hope our limited space is what would give us a more unique looking stadium."
Any update concerning SB expansion?

"But a mate of mine reckons that in 2017 you might be ordering a pint before a match at the Cabbage Patch, Webb Ellis or Barmy Arms. "
Yay!! the Barmy Arms - site of much underage drinking on my part!  
Yay!! the Barmy Arms - site of much underage drinking on my part!  
"Rest assured, it's still very good for over-age drinking too. So long as you're not in a desperate hurry for the loo on a matchday."
They don't even love the rugby fans!  They had quite a bit of bother recently during the sevens with anti-social behaviour by some - crapping in people's gardens etc so I heard.  
The Bear is on the main street just up from the Barmy Arms. Pretty good for sport on tv and food before a game.
"Ah I know the one you mean - never been in there as far as I know.  Thinking about it, there's loads of pubs in Twickenham I've never been to - we just used to stick to a few, our favourite is now Santander Building Society.  I've been to the Webb Ellis many years ago when it was a real dive called the Rugby Tavern.  I guess there and the Cabbage Patch would be the obvious drinking venues for pre-match - and the Albany as well though that's become a bit trendy and expensive and I don't know whether they'd welcome Chelsea fans?  "
Albany probably wouldn't. There's the one right on the corner opposite the Cabbage Patch....think there's a club above it called The Loft. Anyway that would be ok because it's a bit of a sh*thole but it's really spacious. The Webb Ellis is a Wetherspoons now so it's pretty standard. Be interesting to see the situation with drinking in the stadium. At the moment you can take drinks to your seats but they charge you £1 per plastic glass and you have to return it to get it back.
I thought the one opposite the Cabbage Patch was the Webb Ellis!  Doh!   Just googled it and it's the old post office - never been in there.  So the old Rugby Tavern is still a sh*thole then!  It never even used to sell real ale back in the day and you felt like you'd stick to anything you touched!

"I like the look of that. I really want something unique, not for us to play in yet another soulless bowl. I'm really hoping that one of the ends is like the Dortmund 'Wall' - An enormous Lower Tier that just keeps going up!"
Thank god we won't have another Emirates or Etihad.
Early days but I am excited with these proposals.
I know this is obviously at an early stage but do we think this has a decent change to be approved?
Am going to the Bridge tonight to see the plans and meet the consultants.
I hope they keep the memorial wall. Two of my Brothers have plaques on it.
"Isn't asking about standing a little bit pointless, we know the answer."

"Going by the pictures i have to say i'm not that keen on the design to be honest, maybe it'll come across better in other pictures released in the future."
Haven't we recruited the designers of the allianz arena? I heard this a while ago. It could be the reason why this looks really aesthetically pleasing.

"I love all the brickwork, I've seen enough glass and panel clad monstrosities in London to last me a lifetime. Let's hope this is a goer as we'll have a rarity on our hands, a distinctive new stadium, love it to bits."
I had hoped for a large single tier for at least one of the ends behind the goals to create a proper 'home end' but unfortunately I fear the middle tier being all corporate is a sad reality of modern football.
I'll get my trowel out.
East stand will be the new daddy ??
"One thing I don't quite understand is the fact we have always been told an expansion of this scale was impossible, yet here we are, a bridge to the station, the architects design a ground on the site and voila, suddenly it could be a goer."
"The Eastern block is more concrete than brick Brick seems to be the choice of architects who have designed some of the newer 'retro' US baseball stadiums, which look really good, like this one in NYC (the NY Mets):"
Have they said anywhere what materials it would be built with? I'm imagining that yellow/cream finish of the current stadium or maybe something that gives it a London Portland stone look - can't see it being built in red brick.
"Davey the problem was never being able to build a big enough stadium, it was always about convincing the council we can empty it after a game, and could evacuate it safely if need be. F&h council seem much easier to deal with now a threat of us moving away was real."
Will ask about the Memorial wall Shelly. I know a couple of people who have plaques on it.
"Davey the problem was never being able to build a big enough stadium, it was always about convincing the council we can empty it after a game, and could evacuate it safely if need be."
"Yes, that's what I mean. The site is big enough for a stadium but not much else, i.e. no room to walk around and get out, particularly as you can only get out on Fulham Road."
This will be the jewel in the crown of the dynasty Roman is building to hand over to his son/s.
"But we gain more space on the ground by building over the railway line behind the east stand, and we also gain space by increasing the building volume, that certainly looks that way looking at those side sections of the stands."
"I wasn't aware we propose building over the railway line. Also, pardon my ignorance, but what do you mean by the bit in bold? I'm sure it's obvious but I'm being a bit dumb. Are you talking about space inside the stadium or outside?"
"Inside we gain more space, sorry for not being clearer, but if you look at those side sections of the stands you can see on the north stand and east stand the railway tracks underneath the back of the stands, it's very faint but can just make the trains out as well."
"Brilliant, I'd appreciate that too as a family friend is up there. Thank you"
"Shelly and Gem (and others), the Memorial Wall will stay which is excellent news. The remains of the old Shed Wall will also stay. More comments etc about last night's meeting with the consultants to follow later. Typing them up at the moment."

Really enjoyed that Boyne; would love to have attended myself so really appreciate the insight. 
The height of the new stadium will be the same as the current one; that is to ensure that views from surrounding buildings are not blocked. Apparently a resident has said that their view of Richmond Park will be spoilt if the height of the stadium is increased. Not sure how that will be the case given that Stamford Bridge is the tallest building in the area. Also building higher will block out more sunlight; one of the concerns of the residents of the Oswald Stoll Home when the new West Stand was built in the nineties. I think it is only right and proper that we cater for our service veterans.
This is all incredibly awesome! Great to see Roman's commitment.
"Thanks Boyne, brilliant stuff."
"Thanks Boyne, brilliant stuff."
"The thing i like about this idea, and i hope it happens, is we don't need an 80k, 90k, or even an 100k stadium. Stamford bridge is nice and compact, so gives that homely feel, all the while being intimidating because of the close proximity to the pitch. If you look at the likes of the Nou camp and Bernabeu, it's like they're just showpieces without having that sense of ""home"" to them. Don't get me wrong, they're iconic stadiums, but it's always, to me, felt as though these huge stadiums are just for show and nothing else. I hope this new stadium will have that same homely feel to it, because that is what makes SB unique. "

The brick idea is a good one for all......helps raise some funds and leaves a fan his mark on the stadium.
"I went to the consultation last night, ended up having a few pints after hence me only posting now!!"
Thanks for the info Carshalton 
So is this definitely happening or is there a projected date on when the stadium is likely to be officially green lit? 
From the drawings/plans I have seen I think the design will be a hit or a miss with supporters.
The brick idea is a good one for all......helps raise some funds and leaves a fan his mark on the stadium.
"Not all that pricey actually, my local team Hibs sold plagues to go down one side of the stadium, there were different sizes but it started from about £65ish if I recall correctly I've got one up there and I'd love to have one at Stamford bridge as well! Granted if they're engraving brick it might be a bit more expensive!"
I tell a lie.........
Got a few bricks at Ibrox.
"Another thing i forgot to add was i asked about us moving out & where could we play, a fella in a Chelsea suit & tie said ""every venue we've asked have all said yes we can play there, the stumbling block is they need dates or an idea when it'll be so they can plan for it, but obviously we cant give them any dates yet."
I can see it being Wembley as the have turned down others in the past. 
The FA are desperate for money and to use Wembley. 
Wembley is basically our second home anyway
"Just seen this elsewhere, few points already been posted but also some that havent so..."
Reading the stuff from you (Carshalton Blue) and Boyne really does fill me with optimism..The 'Abramovich' legacy will be every bit as special and historic as the Mears and Bates contribution to our club over the years.
Went to the exhibition today.
Good post Davey .  Do people think this will get the go ahead ? 
"Brilliant Davey, once again thank you for the write up, bloody exciting times. "
"All sounds good. Sounds like croke park lay out ie being able to walk round within the stadium. Also when it's like that there is plenty of bars, happy days"
"5. The South Stand will see the biggest increase in capacity, it will double more or less. The North Stand is the only stand which will get taller to any meaningful degree. It will also see a significant capacity increase, as will the East, while the West will more or less stay the same, in terms of capacity."
Has anything been said about the names of the stands? Will North still be Matthew Harding and South the Shed End? Or is this too premature?

Might be a bit late asking this now but has anyone asked if there could be sight restrictions within the new stadium (like there are at the moment at the back of the MH lower)?

"I have been to Citi Field a few times when visiting the folks back in NY. It is a very nice stadium but from a baseball standpoint you cannot walk around the lower tier to see the game. They closed it off for suites. It is a bit of a bother but the rest of the stadium is superb and far better than Yankee Stadium. Here in Denver, brick is everywhere and it is open all along the bottom deck. It is a nice feature because outside in the concourse you can grab a bite or drink aand nestle up to field without having to pay for the premium seats. Spent many days buying a ticket in the upper deck but stood pretty much at field level knocking back pints (OK, they're plastic cups of shoddy American beer) and watching a game. I am sure to be biased but Coors Field is perhaps the finest places to catch a baseball game. If you do decide to sit on the right field side and in the upper deck which face west you get to see the sun set over the mountains."
I'm biased but the best US baseball stadium I've been to is AT&T Park. I guess for the setting more than anything else. Do love some of the older ones like Wrigley though. 
I also like the 'old school London' type feel of the bars and cafes under the 'viaduct passageway' ... I can well imagine that will be very atmospheric on matchday.
Really like it.

I suppose what you have to bear in mind is that we already own the land we will be building on. I can imagine a significant amount of money for the Emirates stadium was buying the 20 o or so acres of land it is built on. 
"I can´t believe that RA will sell the name. When you spent hundreds of millions for your beloved club, it makes little sense to get back a few of them later by selling an important part of the clubs history."

I heard that it will be named Stamford Abramobridge.
I would be very surprised if we didn't tender out for naming rights. Stupid money to be made there.
As has been said...Sir Roman will recoup 500 mil very swiftly in many many ways....500 mil to him is a couple of boats he doesnt now need to buy........Love the guy.....All we need to do is convince the planners to make an end accoustically able to allow me to sing and drown out 3000 spuds...This will happen...The new ground at its present location will be done by the time im 65 and still able ( hopefully) to abuse spuds loudly
I am starting to get the feeling we are slightly further advanced in this process that I initially thought. One would imagine the more detailed plans are already in existence but the club are choosing to gradually drip feed the information to gauge reaction and act accordingly as opposed to just steaming in with everything at once which is probably a good call. 
I just want them to get on with it - the designs look stunning and if built correctly could create an amazing atmosphere. Please get it done in my bloody life time!
This may sound silly but will the money spent on the new stadium hinder us financially like arsenal were after the Emirates was built?

No issue with selling the naming rights. As fans we'll still colloquially refer to it as 'The Bridge' and there's too much money there to be made. Ideally our home would always be called Stamford Bridge but unfortunately money takes precedence over romance in Football these days.
^ Actually there is little money involved in naming rights. 
This new stadium plan looks good. I'm very happy for you guys who live there and go to the games frequently.

"Arsenal receive around £30 million a year from Emirates, though that includes shirt sponsorship so it's hard to know the actual breakdown. Suffice to say any figure for naming rights for our stadium will be huge, and a route I'm sure the club will take."
"No, Its not hard at all. Considering dippers get 25m for their shirt sponsorship, arsenal will get atleast as much. So £30m minus £25m is £5m. Easy peasy."
You do know Arsenal will likely have different terms than another club right?
arsenal getting at least as much as the dippers is a fair assumption to make. So the ball park works. 
We aren't sponsored by KFC for a start.
I'd rather have less money and not have a stupid brand name on the Bridge personally. It's not like we need the money.

Not sure where the extra will go (though we were speculating), or if we'll have to move elsewhere while the building work is being done. Sounds promising though."
"I mocked up the model in 3ds max.  Crested a spline line tracing of the stands, extruded them to form the model so it would be an exact replica and very accurate down to even the exact number of rows, spacing between tiers etc. when I get more details to work from, I will do a proper photographic render.

So if we end up at Wembley for 3 years will we have to sing

They will never fill it and will not lift anything of note trophy wise there.
The 17K single tier stand is what I had hoped we would incorporate but by all accounts it just can't be done on our site.

Hi guys. 
Spurs have a big support I think they will fill it. Still wont have pork pies
I don't have any doubt they'll fill it.
Honestly believe Spurs would fill a 60k on a Wednesday night FA cup 3rd round with the likes of Gillingham or Doncaster? I think even we would struggle with that to be fair
They would in the league.  Like I said spurs have a big support.  Also I believe they have a huge waiting list for season tickets.
Not being from London and having never been to North London means I can't really comment but I assume Spurs and Arsenal can draw on a larger fanbase due to the larger population. Is this true? I can't imagine we can boast the same numbers in our 'upper class' West London?
I'd agree with that a lot of our support comes from outside sw6.  Saying that I saw a recent survey not sure where but apparently spurs fans travel the furthest for home games.  Tottenham is a very poor part of London so its really a hard one to call
Yeah historically we've always had a big home counties support I'm sure we have more clued up people on this forum then me on that subject

"I think we've always had wide support in Surrey etc as it's so close to West London (just like Essex people support West Ham).  But from the working class who live there - not everyone who lives in Surrey is a golf playing, foccacia eating accountant!  Of course as house prices have gone up, you need to be more affluent to live there now though.  But in the past it was mainly working class from Surrey not middle class - middle class fans at any club were a rarity."
I'd generally agree with this but would it be reasonable to say we have a good following in Essex too? And has there ever been any club that drew support almost exclusively from the Middle/Upper class? What with it being the 'working mans' game and all
Cheers anyway mate I was just looking for the general thought amongs other fans etc

"Tottenham unveil their plans, what do we think?"
"I think the design is very bland. It kinda looks like s toilet bowl from the air. Inside it is nice but unremarkable, apart from the 'kop' end they have added which is nice. Given the blank canvas they have in terms of little site restrictions, I'd be disappointed to have a cookie cutter stadium that is just another Emirates style, off the shelf design. The Chelsea design is far more unique and interesting, and has been created having huge restrictions on design that the Spurs stadium didn't have. "

"Haz139 We traditionally have a lot of support from Fulham, Chelsea (Worlds end, Lots Road etc) Battersea, Wandsworth, Camberwell etc. A lot of working class people were socially cleansed from many previous working class parts of London, and as in our case a lot of supporters who have a strong family connection to CFC moved out to places like Sutton, Ewell etc. We also have a strong support in parts of Kent, Swanley in particular for some reason. A lot of it has to do with were the trains come in i.e. Victoria and Charing Cross for Kent, which makes getting to Stamford Bridge easier, on the District Line."
"Don't think anyone mentioned this but according to Tim Rolls (CPT) there's going to be 15000 of corporate seats, which seems like an absurd amount. I think its slightly concerning since we've struggle to generate a good atmosphere as of late. I'm sure many will agree that it would be good to see the east and west stand actually getting involved and backing the team. Watering down both stands with people who aren't there for the football is a real shame. "

He's talking about Spurs stadium. 
I was aware of that !
"Love the phrase ""gentrification of London"""
"It didn't seem very gentrified this morning on the way into work...Mad cyclists, distressed walkers and angry bus travellers..."
Yeah historically we've always had a big home counties support I'm sure we have more clued up people on this forum then me on that subject
Thanks for all the replies to my point guys/ladies. As I said not being from London not really sure how the population is spread out etc. thanks again!

"It wasn't always 'social cleansing'. A lot of people moved away from those inner London boroughs through choice as they weren't particularly nice places to live in. Back then it was more desirable to get a house in the sticks, but now it is the opposite. If you have a place in Brixton (for example) now you're laughing, but back in the 80s it was hell."
True enough although I suppose I was really referring to Fulham and Chelsea re: the social cleansing...Lots of people had no chance of getting a council house or being able to afford to buy...Remember what a sh*t hole Notting Hill was look at it now !!!!

Roman is paying for this stadium all by himself.
Has that actually been confirmed anywhere? He may contribute but I'd be surprised if he's paying the whole £500m+ himself.

"And in terms of the overall shape of the roof, compare my render to the original image CFC created. Now granted, I haven't modelled the detail such as entrances, or stairs. But this was merely an exercise to give an impression of the roof, not to make a detailed model of the building details. "

Wonderful stuff mate. I genuinely think the club should be paying/employing you for these designs. 
"Your a genius Neilando, great designs."
"Thanks guys. But, they are not my designs and I take no credit for them. It's just fun trying to make a better representation of the few images and blue prints we have. The genius is those who came up with the original design. "
Just so you know these pics are going viral mate 
"Yes I read that article and I didn't particularly like it. Maybe you can post a link as I've forgotten where it was. For me, he had a sense of entitlement that didn't sit right with me."

Lol my bad
Of course we should be grateful to Roman for all he has done

I get where you're coming from but it will be worth the hassle in terms of keeping up with the Joneses.
"I can't put my finger on a figure , but from your excellent render it looks horribly like the Emirates design with the corporates splitting the stadium in half with a disastrous effect on atmosphere."
 
Bjd: thanks. How dya mean they're going viral? That's cool! Will be great if lots of people see them so we get lots of feedback to the club. It is after all our stadium as well as Roman's. Where have the pix been shared?

^Much appreciated. Great work neilando 
If the roof does turn out like that then surely it's going to cause light issues for the locals? 
The roof is pretty much the same height as existing structures. Hence the severe slops. The stand the has the most significant height increase is the shed. But the new shed stand matches the footprint and height profile of the existing hotel complex. So there would be no change is light that may affect neighbours. Very clever. 
Credits due where credits due if that's the case. Anyone know what the spaces between buttresses are going to be filled with? Will it be a solid structure apart from the circular opening or will there be some kind of glass? panelling between buttresses in order to get more light?
"The new stadium is basically the east stand wrapped around all four sides. The three tiers each have almost exactly the same slo, size, and number of rows as the current east stand. The top tier obviously changes height as it goes around the stadium. "

Good work and well put together but I don't look like that its going to be the most atmospheric of stadiums especially with the ring of coparate seats.  Oh how I wish we had a single tier stand.  Maybe its just not an option.  
"Slightly off topic but my mate who's an artitech said that the guys who are designing the stadium are world class, top of the range. He said that they've only recently just got a website - they don't need to sell or promote their company because of the high quality stuff they do."
And has anyone got any idea about the steepness of the stands? As someone who's sat in the east upper several times just wondered if it will be a similar steepness or maybe even steeper if that's possible?
Where did you get this info from? Sounds good if true and isn't there already some seats with hand rails in the east upper towards the top?

By the way 'Neilando' welcome to the 'Shed end'..And f**k me what an entrance !!! 
I always thought a render was something you put on a wall with a trowel or float and then painted?
I was always a little disappointed the Batersea thing fell through. I thought there was a lot of potential there.

I know this is a pipe dream but it would be handy if a match day pub was incorporated into the new complex somewhere.

Yeah I drink in west Brompton.
Drink in the Lillie myself id imagine if we move out for 3 years pat and Mary would struggle 
"Regards pubs, i totally agree with the above posts."
I used to like the white Hart outside Fulham Broadway had a disco down the back on a Friday 
Is anybody worried the stadium expansion will cause us to have te problems Arsenal did with the Emirates in that we won't be able to spend big in the transfer market?

Yeah I drink in west Brompton.
Imperial's long gone.  Made over a couple of season's back.
Of course.  Sorry.
Its tiny in the imperial.  If we move for 3 years the pubs and restaurants will miss us big time 
That's my fear Graham; I struggle to see how these pubs would survive for 3 years with no match day income when it must represent a big chunk of their annual income overall.

Any updates on how the consultation with the local community went? Or it is too soon for updates on that?
"Totally agree with you there, the technology now is brilliant, take a look at the Sydney opera house and imagine that is the outside of our new stadium, half of our games are played when its dark, would look immense on CL nights."
"We are apparently the club with the largest percentage of our seats sold per game, selling 99.82% of our capacity."
Hi
You single pal? Because if your not you will be with the amount of effort you put into the designs lol.  I appreciate your efforts 
"To give a little perspective to the dimensions of the stadium, if you consider that each block on the west lower in my render is 25seats x 28 rows = 700 seats per block, multiplied by 7 blocks which is 4900 seats in the west lower. "
"Haha, nope not single. But honestly, these images take very little effort or time for me to do. "
Again great effort

"Hi. Here is a first *rough* colour render. I've so many things to fix on this image, but thought I'd show you what progress has been made. "
"Great work, yet again."
Excellent picture. Thanks for posting and for all your work.
Looks jolly good - thanks mate for your superb job. 
No one else worried it looks too much like the etihad and the Emirates with that middle tier and shape? 
"I think that of course, it shares similarity with those other modern stadiums. However, I do think th design is very unique. I haven't been able to post enough views from within the stadium to make that point.  But th roof and certainly the exterior will make this stadium extremely different. It is very bespoke. "
Definitely the roof and exterior could add a real sense of uniqueness- I.e the Allianz arena inside is one of those 'lifeless bowls' but the exterior makes it so much better. Would it be entirely unfeasible to get a single tiered stand in there??

I dont think theres enough room for a big single stand a la Dortmund
Neilando has updated his render
I don't like the roof. 
It reminds me of the spaceship in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. I say keep it!
I just can't see how the grass would get enough sunlight. The last thing we want is to build a new stadium and the have to replace the pitch twice a season

It looks amazing
That lower tier looks massive. Bugger than I expected if it indeed happens
"I remember that was a major problem in the Amsterdam Arena. Haven't heard about it in quite a few years now, either they fixed it or they are keeping very quiet about it."
"Hi.  So I thought I would do one last render, and this view shows the shed end stand, (since this is the shed end forum after all) ;)"
...and here it is without the roof and lighting system. 
"Am I the only one sad to think of the possibility of losing the character of our mismatched stadium? Like the wall that sticks out on that one side. This would be too perfect, needs something.....can't put my finger on what."
Seems like the pitch will struggle to receive any light and that it will be very dark in the upper tiers?

"Will the pitch still stay the same size? seeing as the developers are talking of building down, i would assume the pitch won't be widened. "

Not sure the London climate would allow that
Well on the upside we would have Londons biggest swimming pool to clam in as our own.

Ossie's ashes were place in an urn so I guess it's just a case of removing the urn and re-burying it after the work is completed.
The empty seats were just to help show the stadium seating structure and layout a bit.

"Opps, wrong video, sorry. "
The team will light up the pitch every other Saturday (or Sunday or Monday....)
A Scoping Report has been submitted to Hammersmith & Fulham Council by Chelsea to establish the environmental impact that any proposed development might have. It's one of the first steps before a full planning application is submitted. It's interesting because it describes the proposed new stadium (no images yet - they'll be in the full application).
"Great find fitz, lots of info to digest there, thanks"
Sweet!
"The bit about the proposed spectator mix is also interesting given the rumours of 15,000 corporate seats."
 Would the new stadium ever make it as the champions league final venue? Isn't the Allianz of similar size? 
Would the new stadium ever make it as the champions league final venue? Isn't the Allianz of similar size?
I was told at the consultation that the new stadium will not meet the UEFA criteria for a top stadium and would never be used for a CL final. In fact they specifically stated that the stadium has been designed specifically as our home and as a football stadium and would never be used for any other purposes including rock concerts and other sporting events like boxing.
Looks like the whole of Uncle Kens village is going to be rubble!
whilst that's great it would've been nice to host the final as only United have done it in England? Unless I'm wrong
"That's right I believe but as a concern it just doesn't bother me. Much more important to have a big beautiful new stadium to call our own. Just finding a way to fit a 60,000 stadium on such a compact piece of land is a miracle in my view."
"The bit about the proposed spectator mix is also interesting given the rumours of 15,000 corporate seats."
Also a considerable drop in away fans places when compared to full capacity. From 7.1% to 4.3%.

No it's 10'431 corporate seats.

"I understood that under Ken Bates, he could not make the ground bigger because of the lack of exit points from the ground. You can only get to it from Fulham Road, and the authorities did not like so many crammed on one road. The ground is blocked in by the tube line, cemetary and school. There was talk of a walkway bridge over the railway line or cemetary to seagrave road, but it was not feasible. can someone explain how the club has got around this? Did the local authority relax their objections about the crowd numbers using  Fulham Road?"

"City were struggling to keep their stadium full before they expanded. I don't even know why they bothered expanding the stadium really, it seems pointless if they couldn't even fill it up before the expansion. I don't think Chelsea will have the same problem, Stamford Bridge is pretty full as it is now, getting to 60,000 shouldn't be too hard. Our fanbase has grown massively since the arrival of Roman."
"indeed but will we fill out for a Wednesday night capital one cup game to the likes of Macclesfield etc? We'd be lucky to get 50,000 for them games I think"
Even teams like United would fail to fill their stadium up in a League Cup match against lower league teams. I'm sure we will get it full in the Premier League and Champions League games.

United has a lot of empty seats for mid week league cup games. They announce big attendance because all season tickets are charged for their seats whether they're there or not

I heard the also give free tickets to local schools
as someone from Manchester I can confirm this. City do as well as do the local cricket teams. It's not a bad idea tbh- gets the kids involved and adds to the future fanbase
"Regards giving tickets away, i cant see why when the likes of Hull for example dont sell out their allocation & there's a big block of empty seats local schools & community youth clubs cant be given the tickets, it'd be great PR for Chelsea, loads of kids might then start to support us if they dont already which will benefit the club in the future, its not rocket science. "
"I have to say Man City have sorted their new three tiered stand to perfection in every way, sts were given the chance to move to a new singing area in the stand which most did, season cards were sold at only £299 as well, they've actually listened to their supporters groups & worked with them, i just hope Chelsea will do the same."
City costs so little because a) their owners don't need the money as they've already fiddled the income and b) because they have hardly any fans compared to United.

Wembley is our second home anyway so it's quite good in that respect!
Of course it will not be easy to fill 50k in midwinter vs Sunderland or Bournemouth - but against the top teams in the EPL and in the champions league there would be a bigger demand than 50k.

"I see there's plans to open a new Chelsea station in the Kings Road for the new Cross rail line 2, locals are opposing it though."
"If Chelsea have any sense they'll do cheaper season tickets, make sure we have a proper home end where our younger fans can go & make some noise, otherwise if everyone is spread out the atmosphere will be crap."
I agree with this. also away fans will get a bigger allocation might be a lot of away fans first day out at Wembley
Minutes from the CPO Board Meeting on 30 July. Point 2 covers the redevelopment of the ground.
"League cup ties v lower league clubs will be interesting, wonder if we'd sell it out & how many a smaller club would bring?"
I reckon if you gave 12000 tickets to a lower league club they would be snapped up
Apparently we're just awaiting sign off from the Premier League to play at Wembley Stadium for 3 seasons
Not sure if this has been posted or not but I'll post it anyway.

Atmosphere was different, it didnt seem to help anyway with lacklustre performances. Wenger said, they did not feel like they were at home and the visiting teams did not feel like they were playing away, but at a neutral venue"

"I went to Stamford Bridge for the presentation on the re-development of the ground. The presentation was based on the consultations with fans and local residents and businesses in June; other meetings with fans, businesses, residents and the Council; and plans which have been produced. There was a model of what the new ground and surrounding area will look ahead if the re-development goes ahead. There were a number of photographs of the new ground including views of it from surrounding areas. As I've mentioned before I'm a ST holder in the Matthew Harding Upper and am a Chelsea Pitch Owner (CPO)."
Great stuff Boyne. You forgot to tell us what you thought of the stadium!!!!!
"Nice write up, thanks for the info Boyne."
"Davey Baby and Scott, thanks for your posts."
That was quick!
Paddy Power is humour for the retarded. 
Paddy power is a prick and a LFC fan
A few more things I picked up from the consultation which I don't think were mentioned by Boyne. Again in no particular order.
"Really random question, anyone know what will happen with the Peter Osgood statue? "
"I have to say it looks very good. The bricks make it feel solid, stable, even monumental. They slightly vary in color to avoid a dullness, and show a lot of attention to detail.  It means it will be more expensive to build and will take more time, but I am glad the club takes this step because this will be the home for the club for a very long time. The huge atrium inside the main entrance is a grand idea which puts me in awe just thinking of it! There is nothing more intimidating than a 10 metres high entrance hall!"
"The only concern I have is the circular roof because it just does not fit the rest. In my opinion the top of the roof should have the same outline as the stadium itself, maybe slightly less edgy. It would be asymmetrical and probably not quite compliant with the architecture hundreds of years ago but it would, in my opinion, improve the looks of the stadium from above by a lot. Right now it goes from asymmetrical to circular to rectangular when looking from above and I can't see any homogeneity in it. Maybe they have considered this, but left it circular because it is cheaper and they thought no one would see it from down below anyway. "
"The circular roof gives a nod to the circle in Brompton Cemetery, which may have been a planning consideration. Either way I doubt money was a factor, as previously it was deemed economically unfeasible to expand on the current site, whereas Roman has now seemingly decided that this will be his legacy which he will pass on to his son and he's prepared to go the whole hog."

"I see, but would you say it is a good decision in terms of design?"
"Mr Parker's Dogbite, thanks for your comments."
"I know Mr Parker is on the architectural forum, maybe he can ask about an asymmetrical roof, in terms of logistics and aesthetics, or maybe he's an architect or engineer himself and he can answer. "
"Mr Parker's Dogbite, thanks for your comments."
"I went to the consultation last night, i have to say i was more impressed with the actual pictures on display than the actual model."
"I know Mr Parker is on the architectural forum, maybe he can ask about an asymmetrical roof, in terms of logistics and aesthetics, or maybe he's an architect or engineer himself and he can answer."
That would be great if someone could explain! Thanks!
I forgot to say i was told local residents are 76% in favour of the new ground.
"I like the idea of lion statues, that could look impressive."
I will probably go to the exhibition tomorrow and ask them about it amongst other things.
Fantastic write ups from the three who went - really appreciate you all taking the time to share in such detail. I must admit I'm ruddy excited. 
I'll second what gem said.  Thanks 
Stamford bridge was a big part of my childhood I got a great buzz from watching it develop so I wasnt really happy about knocking it   however I'm starting to get excited about these new plans. 
Is it true it will be designed by the same people that did the alianz arena?

"thanks to Boyne, Carshalton Blue and Mr Parker's Dogbite for those really informative reports. It will be amazing, probably the most impressive stadium in England and competing with anything we've seen in recent years worldwide - Wow! "

will the maximum capacity be 60k or is there any chance we can go to 65k? 
says possibly 65k in the article.

I'm kind of 50/50 on what I've seen so far:
"Really wanted a single tier end, more seats for regular fans and a ""vocal section"". Doesnt seem like its gonna happen though. Really wish there was t so many corporate seats, bit thats the business i guess"

"Been there today and was quite impressed. The pictures there are even more detailed than the ones posted on the internet - probably due to quality loss of taking a photo. In any case, there is a lot to look forward to."

"Completely agreed on the circular design. They told me the decision was made based on a local cemetery. If you look at the stadium as a whole it is generally a structure with many edges and corners, which is why a circle just does not fit in. This is why the stadium looks a lot more impressive from the side than from above. I think they could improve the overall looks a lot by removing that circle. Also we would not have to worry about other clubs' fans calling it Stamford Graveyard or something like that. "

" I see where you're coming from but you have to take on board the fact the stadium is asymmetrical not through choice but through necessity if we want to maximise capacity. An asymmetrical roof I imagine either wouldn't protect everybody from the elements or if it did, there would be an issue with shadows on the pitch or the pitch seeing enough sunshine and the grass growing. "
Well said on all counts. Though I continue to argue that case that the stadium is very nearly symmetrical if you bisect the stadium across the halfway line. It's what they call bilateral symmetry.

Anyone got any info on how the expect to drain the roof structure? That is potentially a lot of water draining off onto the sidelines since it slopes downward and in

"But the actual opening of the roof is rectangular. The circle just (beautifully, in my view) encloses it.  And the consultants were very clear that each of the stands would have their own character. If we're going to get a 60,000 stadium the of course the corners will have to be filled in but that doesn't mean it will just be a generic bowl. Just look at the aerial shot from above. It's anything but 'just another bowl'. Anything but 'just another stadium'"

"Does anyone know what the projected match-day revenue will be for the new stadium? According to this we currently stand at £71m per season. If we assume that the new capacity will be exactly 60000 and, on average, we do as well in cup competitions then the increase will be roughly 43.55%. If all seating categories were increased proportionally we would end up at approximately £102m - but the focus will be clearly on corporate seats / more expensive categories. Does anyone have a better estimate?"
Evening all. Cheers to all who have posted here so far.
Didn't realise that the new Anfield will only be 51k seats. Thought it would be more 60k. Spurs have got 60.

"It won't be that stiff. Logically there is only so big a stadium can be, and how many bums on seats you can attract. Add to this the increasing commercial and TV revenues are making match day revenue less and less significant as they have a higher ceiling unconstrained by the size of a plot of land, the wealth of match-day fans, and population of a clubs catchment area. In the future the top clubs' stadiums will be as much about being part of the club's brand/image to sell as it is about match-day revenue. "

"Would have been awesome had they been able to secure the Battersea location and have built something awesome there. The preliminary plans that had been released a few years back looked incredible and could have been amazing. I am not too thrilled about the cosmetic look of the new ground, just seems a bit odd, to say the least. Nonetheless, a new ground is much needed and that could definitely benefit in terms of more money to spend with transfers and such."
"I've seen a lot of acrimony on social media towards the naming rights issue, but personally I don't really this is as such a big issue."
"Naming rights isn't an issue as far as I'm concerned. Because we've always played at SB, it will always be known as SB, no matter which sponsor has their name on it."
The Dunkin Donuts Super Dome Arena sounds good to me
Mentioned it before but it should definitely be called the 'Carefree Arena'.

I will never agree with selling naming rights to the highest bidder. ever.

Bearing in mind that ours will be the only new ground in recent history to be built on the same site it wont really matter what the money men want to call it as it will always be Stamford Bridge to us.

We could do a City and have the owner sponsor it for above market value to cook the books
Not keen on naming rights at football grounds personally. I'd prefer them to stick with traditional names like 'the Bovril Gate'  
"Can I ask why? It's never bothered me, simply because it will be a corporate name that will have nothing to do with us fans. They can call it whatever they want but it will still be Stamford Bridge. Calling it ""pedigree chum"" stadium will have pretty much zero impact on fans. Unless it helps bring ticket prices down of course. Oh look, a pig in the sky...."

Makes no sense that we would be looking to stay at Stamford Bridge during the redevelopment. 
I'm quite surprised to see how apathetic a lot of you are about changing the name of the stadium. Chelsea are one of the few English clubs still playing at our original ground. To me that is special and Stamford Bridge has had its name since 1877. To sell off the name and that history for a few quid seems pretty crass in my opinion. Some things are worth more than money and Chelsea already exhaust every single possible financial revenue.

"How much do Chelsea stand to make then Davey? I've heard estimates of around £15-20m a year (I've no idea how accurate that is. Please correct me if I'm wrong). For that kind of amount, I don't think it'd be worth it. The club are seemingly happy to take major financial hits in the transfer market (Torres, Cuadrado for example)...so I don't think selling off the club's historical stadium for a few bob makes sense. By the way, I'm eternally grateful to Abramovich, I just think some things should be sacred. I don't have to agree with every decision he makes."

City had a 400m pound 10 year deal for kit and stadium. So naming rights to the new stadium could be worth 40m a year considering when they signed that deal and when ours will be ready. Yokohama paid 200m over 5 years for our kit alone.
City's stadium/kit deal is just a proxy for the owner to circumvent FFP. It's not even worth half that amount for 10 years.
"Many years ago when sponsorship first appeared on shirts there were complaints, before that sponsorship in programmes had people complaining. How they are the norm, and sponsored ground names will also be the norm soon."
Why mention crespo and duff both done well for us.  Crespos goals for games ratio was very good and duff was a key member of our 05/06 season
"I know. I'm not saying they weren't successes for Chelsea. I'm saying Chelsea wrote off a lot of money on them. We bought Duff for £17m and then flogged him to Newcastle for £5m when he was still young and a good player. How much of the £16-17m spent on Crespo did we recoup? As far as I can remember, not a great deal (or even nothing)."

Always good to increase stadium size and keep the history
We would sell out Utd at home even at 90k. Hell if that match went to general sale I think a lot of non Chelsea fans would go as well. I know Id make a lot more trips if that were the case

Seems the BBC report was referring specifically to LBHF's official response to the EIA scoping report which is now available here (and which includes responses from all the other major bodies associated with the development including RBKC and Network Rail etc). On first glance all the issues identified seem to be technical and should be quite easily resolvable but while this is good news it's not quite a go ahead for the overall development - more an initial OK to the approach being taken.

don't we have a huge waiting list too? And wheres this 61k figure come from. Last I heard Spurs were aiming for the high 50s but not 60k+
I wasnt sure since alot has been said about having trouble filling 60k every game on here.

Not sure about the attendance.  Do we have a big waiting list if so how many thousand didn't think we had a big waiting list
That rendered design looks brilliant
Some more views of the stadium. Let me know if there are particular views you'd like to see.

lol nice! showing sky sports news so we can keep one eye on the other scores at the time! Maybe they could split screen so we can see replays of our game and sky sports news on the other half. 
"Here is a view from the shed end/East stand corner upper tier, looking towards the west stand. The players entrance is in the opposite corner. Notice also the very asymmetric slops to the upper tier of the west and north stands. "
^ Are you sure that's where the tunnel goes? I know the dug outs are planned for the West Stand and I thought the tunnel would be right between those.
I have modelled the exterior now too.

"Fantastic images, Neilando."
"Great renders, Neilando. Are you using C4D? I am a bit of hobbyist but haven't had much time lately. Are you planning on adding materials to this? "
What will be the position of  TV cameras.. any idea ? . I wish they install it in the west stand so that it shows the huge east stand and its corners during the telecast of matches ... all stadium model pictures of the east stand and its corners make it look massssive ...
Rumours this morning that we have offered the FA £60m for use of Wembley Stadium for four years (three for construction and one year as contingency)

The Daily Mail says the planning application is being submitted today. Fantastic news.
"How long it be for a decision? If it approved, when will work actually begin?"
"How long it be for a decision? If it approved, when will work actually begin?"
A planning application for a new stadium at Stamford Bridge with an expanded seating capacity has been submitted. This follows a successful consultation process during which we received very helpful feedback.
Looks absolutely amazing
love the 2nd picture showing how we will have direct access to Fulham Broadway and how we would use/build a tunnel over the railway line by the cemetery makes much more sense now ....looks amazing ................let's hope dufuss at number 23 doesn't oppose and delay the project even more ...
"Other than Chelsea / Roman pulling out what reasons could actually scupper the plan now, considering all the background work that has been done already?"
Good to see that we have an owner who cares for this club. It looks amazing.
Yeah that 2nd pic Is giving me a chub on; what a beautiful stadium it will be. 
Is it going to stay at Fulham Broadway?
Can only presume the club have an alternative venue virtually lined up now they have submitted the application and that they must be confident this will get the green light. Looks amazing. 
So 6 months for approva will be June 2016. When would work start? Am I right in thinking we would move out for 3 seasons from 2017/18 season?
Yeah... pretty excited.
Is it going to stay at Fulham Broadway?

Statement from the CPO Board
"I personally think it looks dated, not a huge fan of the shape either.  Just my thoughts"
Dated? I can understand why some people think it looks ugly (though I completely disagree) but what old stadium looks like this in any way? It's unique.
Agreed.
"I think he refers to the architectural style, which is certainly not contemporary. They said it was inspired by Westminster Abbey, which underlines his statement."
How can it be dated though when no other stadium has that look?
How can it be dated though when no other stadium has that look?
Surely the CPO I'll approve of the plans right?
"Westminster Abbey was built in 1090, if its borrowing styles from that then sure, you could adapt that in a modern way.. but I don't think that is done here."
"Honestly, looks awful."
"It's certainly unique, but than in itself doesn't make it appealing."
I think it looks ok and it's refreshing to see a stadium that looks unique.
I love it. Looks like a Colosseum.
"Our stadium could be an overturned dog feeding bowl, but as long as it's ours and at the same location and still be called Stamford Bridge, I will love it."
So where's the funding coming from? Roman directly? Or are we getting a bank loan?
Fully funded by our benevolent owner I believe. What a guy.

Some more views from the planning application.
"leaving the design to one side, I can't understand why they've chosen masonry over 100% concrete: that masonry will be much more expensive than concrete to construct."
I think the way it merges in with the views from the Cemetery tells you why they've gone with the brick. The stadium is surrounded by three different conservation areas and there will be 'partial' views of it from a long way away (even Richmond Park according to the planning documents). The brick helps to blend it in with the surrounding area.
"yeah - must be the ""heritage"" factor."
I bet splishsplosh will make a comment on how empty the new stadium is going to be.

"I am with the some of the others who are not in love with the design. Maybe it will grow on me. Guess it is a personal preference as I love modern stadiums like the Allianz Arena but as someone said, it is our stadium and I will love it."
im glad we are staying on the Fulham road....but .the only thing that links us to the old Stamford bridge is the post code...where is the character ....a concrete catastrophe.....
"there will always be people who don't like the design, no matter what they chose. i'd hardly call it a catastrophe though."
I absolutely hate the look of the Allianz arena. Think this is very good myself. 
"I think it's excellent, the brick gives it a proper 'London' feel. It looks similar to railway arches or victorian bridge engineering. It will blend in nicely with the surrounding area but still have a modern feel to it. Big thumbs up from me."
Don't think you can get a real idea of what it will look like from a series of projected images...I'm confident it will look great when it's done...people should be happy we are staying at our historical home and not moving to some soulless venue like Emirates and Etihad are
Plans are exciting. Hope they get through the hurdles and work begins early next season
Looks good and really am excited.I never want the club to move away from Chelsea.Will we be at Twickenham or Wembley while we are waiting?
Theres talk of both us and Spurs sharing wembley 
"I can understand why people are hesitant towards the design, but in my opinion, it's completely crucial for the atmosphere that the stadium doesn't look like your average Wembley, Emirates, Etihad or even the soulless toilet seat that will be the new White Hart Lane. It's made for football, it needs to be ugly, it needs to intimidate the opposition, it needs to create a vibe that is on the other scale of everything connected with corporate stuff. There will be a lot of corporate seating within the stadium, but with a design like this, that doesn't have to matter. The Bridge today is like a library, but I want it to be a place known for its loud crowd and intimidating atmosphere, and this looks to me like a brilliant start. If we'd gone for a design similar to what Spurs is building, then I think our chances of achieving that would suffer greatly. "
It's a stunner. 
"Still not huge on the design, but this is extremely intimidating!  The graveyard at stamford bridge, where teams rarely never leave alive..."
"On Sky news this morning they were comparing it to a sieve or an egg slicer, they then went on to say it was being built elsewhere in Fulham not at the old Stamford Bridge !  I tweeted Eamoln Holmes, in vain."
I bet splishsplosh will make a comment on how empty the new stadium is going to be.
"Still not huge on the design, but this is extremely intimidating!  "
I absolutely hate the look of the Allianz arena. Think this is very good myself.
Looks good lit up all blue and blue like.
Still on the fence about the looks. Lit up blue and it probably looks great but as it is I'm 50-50.
The Colosseum. It's Roman's Colosseum. Wonder if it will be called as such.
It's beautiful!
Because it's based off of Westminster Palace?
"The Ariel view doesn't look great but at ground level, it looks fantastic. "
"I think it looks great. Blends in with the surrounding area, looks imposing from the outside, gets us to 60k and I can only assume keeps us up to date facility wise. Its miles ahead of anything we have in America in terms of looks and its good to have something distinctive instead of what our rivals will have, outside of ManU. "

This is important of course because if the badge is going to be used to decorate the new stadium (as per the image below) , it needs to be the right one..."
I don't know how true it is but I think I remember one of the arguments when Bates changed the old badge was that 'heraldic' images like the original lion couldn't be copyrighted and thus merchandising couldn't be protected etc. Don't know if that was BS or not?

Yes the red is way too prominent in our original badge. The new one is nice and neat.

"Seems not everyone is happy with Spurs new ground plans, wonder if we'll face the same sort of opposition?"
I hope not. If you look at these 'before and after' images from the planning application I'd say that most of the neighbours are getting a view that is improved. The new building looks lower and more subtle- less of an eyesore. Plus there will be improved access to the tube station and no old buildings (apart from the stadium) are being demolished. I don't think there's anything to stir up any controversy with our plans.
Good pics .  I like the picture from billing street huge difference in the view 
"A plus for us is the negative quote for the spuds stadium  ""We object to the new proposed development because [it is] overbearing, out of scale and out of character with a redbrick Heritage High Road."
"Rubbish, its class & our badge now actually also has red..."
""
 
Someone always complains. This is Britain we're talking about. But I think it will be a relatively small minority. The club have done their job well.
Having read through parts of the planning application it is obvious that they have done literally everything they could to enrich the local culture. They have inclined the roof structure as far as they could so that as much sunlight as possible is preserved and they have studied the bricks of all major buildings around to see what combination is best for the stadium so it blends in. 
"I think it's excellent, the brick gives it a proper 'London' feel. It looks similar to railway arches or victorian bridge engineering. It will blend in nicely with the surrounding area but still have a modern feel to it. Big thumbs up from me."
I can't see how someone could complain for a valid reason.
"Rubbish, its class & our badge now actually also has red..."
"There will be lots of complaints, that's inevitable."
"You're right Davey  someone always complains,  but I think the club have tried to mitigate the impact of the new stadium on the neighbours. A few points from the planning statement."
"A plus for us is the negative quote for the spuds stadium  ""We object to the new proposed development because [it is] overbearing, out of scale and out of character with a redbrick Heritage High Road."
"There will be lots of complaints, that's inevitable."
Thank you for your comprehensive reply.
"I personally think the stadium proposals are stunning and pretty much tick all the boxes of what I would have hoped for, being realistic."
It's different from anything else in football.
"One man's meat is another man's poison. You may call the view from above hideous, I certainly don't agree, and nor do the architects presumably, or Roman. I think it looks stunning, from every vantage."
"To be honest, the planning application reads like the circle on the roof is there for technical reasons rather than aesthetics - to support the roof structure. I might be wrong here, but I doubt they'd have chose this design otherwise."
The circle on the roof is a nod to the cemetery isn't it? 
"The only time the 'circle on the roof' becomes an issue is when you're on a plane conming into Heathrow and by then then there are more important things to worry about, a safe landing for example, I hope my suitcases are on this plane, a terrorist's RPG, etc, etc."
The circle on the roof is a nod to the cemetery isn't it? 
"Officially that's one of the reasons, yes, but they probably just picked it up to make it look like they wanted it to blend in even more. According to the planning application, the major reason is structural support. "
"With all due respect, I think you're missing the point. The circle may be there for structural support, but there is more than one way to skin a cat. Similarly, a roof is there to protect spectators from the elements. We can say, ""It's only there to protect spectators from the elements, otherwise it wouldn't be there"". Well yes, the stadium needs a roof, so the designers design one which jolly well pleases them. I hope you see."
"I think if you've followed the whole story you'll see that it's entirely possible that there is just this one way to skin that cat if you want to find enough room for 60k people. After all, years have gone into planning it."
"I've followed the story very closely for a long time. You're just going to have to get over the roof. If the architects felt it looked hideous, I assure you it wouldn't be there."
"Mate, they were selling it to you... What do you think was the purpose of the whole thing?"
The view from the bridge behind the MH stand looks incredible! I'm glad we have a vantage point to really take in the whole ground.
"It's an incredible project. They were rightly proud of it. If they had to sell it, they weren't having much trouble, let me tell you. The circle and the rectangle you dislike, which is fine, you've had a bee in your bonnet about it since the start. I can assure you the architects feel differently, or it wouldn't be there."
"^ I think you've totally misunderstood that quote. Are you suggesting the architects have designed something which they can't stand the sight of? If not, what's your point?"

"I think it looks good. Lets be real though, it wouldnt be the first time an architect created an eyesore they thought looked good. Happens all the time, saying ""The architects wanted it to look that way"" Isnt really an argument for anything."

Just very grateful to be staying at the Bridge to be honest.Looks an impressive stadium but a costly one to build with all that brickwork though.
"We are staying put and i like the design,win,win."
The design looks fantastic and I share the sentiments of others who love the fact that we're still remaining at our spiritual home.
"The quote from the architect is clearly in reference to the wish to reflect the club's ""specific atmosphere and history"" on the site, their response to the local area and London  (gothic architecture, Westminster Abbey etc) in general. They also point out that in their view ""It is beyond beauty or ugliness""  So they clearly state they don't think it's ugly (it's beyond that) ."
"Many of humanity's most memorable, inspiring, and awe-wielding monuments/edifices are certainly not refined or elegant.  "
It does look awesome from some angles though. Shame they didn't incorporate any lion statues!

"I think Ossies statue will be the only one. That's not because no other player deserves one, but because they want as much space as possible for the crowd to get into and out of the stadium smoothly. Because of that the carving you can see at the base of the piers isn't just there because it's pretty - it's supposed to give people more space to move around the stadium. Smart thinking there."

Both is also an option. Joint statue of them and Drogba celebrating our 1st CL victory.

Would you not need Cole and cech in that aswell

Dan's yer man.

"This may sound harsh, but as long as Cech is playing for Arsenal, i wouldn't want a statue of him up just yet. It wouldn't feel right."
"I agree, not until after he retires. Thats also why Im not so sure Ash should have one or be called a 'legend'. Too many years spent at a direct rival. "
"I agree, not until after he retires. Thats also why Im not so sure Ash should have one or be called a 'legend'. Too many years spent at a direct rival."
"No player currently plying his trade should have a statue. Not until 2020 should anything happen, which as a coincidence, is about the right time the stadium will open."
So does that mean Jimmy Greaves is not a Chelsea legend either?
"Im too young to have seen him, but he played for Spurs after us right? Eh, dunno"

Agree Carshalton Blue. It wouldn't take much for the club to open up one of the rooms for a couple of hours later in the day.Chelsea must open up rooms for all sorts of functions in the week I was at last year's AGM and it started at about 11.00am andif  I remember correctly there was about 70 shareholders there. A later start would certainly get a lot more in. I'll ask the question about why the meeting isn't later.
That'd be good mate i could prob get there for 3/3.30 at a push any earlier ive got no chance.
Before the club start building will the CPO have to be bought out by Roman??

I was quite sceptical when I first saw it. It looked a bit thuggish. But the more I understand the vision the more I like it. Particularly the brick which will let it mature and look awesome for years to come.

"Have to be John Neal for me, struggled through the worst two seasons in the club's history, before spending bargain basement amounts on 5 players who won us the 2nd Division in his third season, and what a lovely team it was to watch, and for me he is responsible for the turn around in the club's fortunes that got us back on the map again."
"For me always felt the club really turned under john neal as well, from the day we got promoted in 1984, we once again became an established top flight club.

Maybe the john Neal suite or john Neal bar would be the least we could do, also something for bobby Campbell as well.I think things like this will remind us of yesteryear, pre roman. "
"For me always felt the club really turned under john neal as well, from the day we got promoted in 1984, we once again became an established top flight club. We had the one season again in div 2 in 88/89 but everyone knew it was for only one season, as we shouldn't never of gone down. Maybe the john Neal suite or john Neal bar would be the least we could do, also something for bobby Campbell as well.I think things like this will remind us of yesteryear, pre roman."
A tribute to John Neal would be great. Did such a wonderful job when he was at the club. So many great players he brought to the club.

Notice of the CPO AGM on 29 January. After the AGM there will be a chance to meet club reps about the redevelopment.
Spurs have matched our bid for Wembley. Does this change anything? How high will we go? This is getting to be serious money and they'll only get more desperate

"The Blazers at the FA are interested in the money, because they obviously need to pay off the big re-building debts, that's why they arrange so many meaningless friendly ! Friendly Ha,ha, ha ! England matches ! "
"It may delay a decision by the FA, they'll want to hear local residents objections to two teams playing there for 12months every weekend for 9months."

"The thing I'm the most worried about regarding us sharing Wembley with Spurs is how well the pitch will hold up when you take into account that there will be played 36 league matches, many cup games, both domestically and in Europe + international fixtures over the course of a season.

"If we and Spurs do share Wembley and we both have good runs in the cups and European matches that could be about 55-60 games played by the two teams. Plus there are the England matches; American Football games' the Rugby League Challenge Cup Final; a few Rugby Union Matches a few concerts( I think Coldplay are playing a few gigs there this year): that is a lot of ""strain"" on the pitch. As AnIrishTrueBlue has written there have been problems with the pitch in the past and it has to be re-laid at least once. If I remember correctly our players complained about the state of the pitch after the 2007 FA Cup Final. The ground-staff are going to have their work cut out."
"Who cares about the pitch, am sure they have the technology to deal with that, the FA would have the money to buy the best machinery and specialist pitch staff to deal with that. "

Worst stadium ever to get to/from been there a couple of times and it's been hellish on each occasion. Couldn't handle it every other weekend IMO.
Not if you have a sister in walking distance of the stadium  .  But the residents would hate it!

Craven Cottage is tiny.  
Craven Cottage is tiny.  
What about 'The Valley' or is that too far east?
"The Valley has a capacity of 27,000 about 1.500 more than the Cottage. Once ST holders have taken their seats it wouldn't leave many seats for members and away fans.  I think it is the most easterly ground in London. "
On the news last week there was an article about Brompton Cemetery being re-furbished. Will be interesting to see if there is any impact on the re-development of the Bridge.
Sounds like Wembley is the only hope then of staying close to West London. Oh well. Thanks for the insights...I find London a fascinating city. I like to compare it to LA (where I grow up). Totally different vibe being London filled w/ history & LA filled w/ Glamour.
"It's funny, there's not much difference in distance from the Bridge to Wembley or Twickenham, but I've always thought of Wembley as north London.  I guess it is only just north and definitely to the west.  But it was completely alien to me growing up.  It just feels completely different.  Though, that said, Twickenham doesn't have the same feel as Fulham either.  I'm rambling now."

"During my stay in London, I can kinda of relate what you are saying about Fulham. You are giving me something I can visualize. I still find it crazy how Stamford Bridge damn smack in the middle of town."
"In the old days, football grounds were always in the middle of town.  Now the rebuilt ones are on the outskirts.  With a lack of pubs nearby which is a shame."
"During my stay in London, I can kinda of relate what you are saying about Fulham. You are giving me something I can visualize. I still find it crazy how Stamford Bridge damn smack in the middle of town."
The location is certainly a big part of the Chelsea identity for me. Being so close to the centre really hit me (in a positive way) when I was first in London.
"then you add the historic part to the equation. I was at this pub having some fish & chips & was told that it was like 800 years old. Hell, my buddy had me goto that pub across the street from Stamford Bridge. Little did I know, I was in the Birthplace of Chelsea Football Club. I love that about London."
"Mate the whole country is filled with history not just London, you can go anywhere here & you'll find an historical link, i love our history, in a lot of villages if your looking for an old church good chance you'll also find an old English pub nearby or vice versa, there's probably 100s of places i could mention."
"Great post, you summed up football here in a few words. Feel exactly the same,pity a lot of souless stadiums have taken the place of some of the good old grounds of days gone."
"Yeah even my local team, Shrewsbury, have moved to a ground on the edge of town.  It's nice but not the same as a ground in the middle of town with loads of pubs to choose from and walking distance from the station."

CPO Chairman's Statement. Read out at today's CPO AGM
Found this image and it raised a laugh. A study from 1963 by Taylor Woodrow called Urban Renewal-Fulham Study which showed a (then) futuristic redevelopment of Fulham Broadway and the surrounding area. The Architects - Archigram proposed covering the whole of Stamford Bridge in a large Geodesic Dome. Never got any further than a few drawings.

"I'm not sure about slogans about winning the CL, wouldnt that be seen as tacky? ""ark at Chelsea bragging for winning one European cup""  would Villa have ""Birmingham's first"" for example, i think they have to be historic & classy looking rather than with the sort of slogan you'd see on a scarf or sticker."
Presumably we should have a revolving gate for our managers to come and go?

"I think we should go for some of those enormous Jurassic park gates, huge wooden things."
"Wow! Really nice! It reminds me a lot of the Colosseum in Rome, have you been there?"
There are very specific dimensions the gates can not exceed unfortunately. Good idea though. I would have liked that! And yes I have spent a lot of time in rome and like the roman architecture. 
Sort of reminds me of the Luzhniki Stadium whenever I see it - not in a bad way.
"I love it but it looks like there are far too many brick pillars round the entrances, it looks like you'll only get about 4 people abreast between the pillars."

"Stamford Bridge doesn't look as good since they removed the advertising boards from the stands in 2008, I probably am the only one who noticed, there is a lack of colour now. Plus the big club crest should have been replaced on the east stand after 2005, the one above the tunnel."
Hahaha cheaper ticket prices will solve nothing ? I'm happy with increased demand and touting if it means people who really want to go to Stamford bridge can go without financially wrecking themselves.

"Would see no reason for that not to be the truth, end of the day the cpo will say that roman doesnt need to have the freehold to redevelop the bridge they would just technically have to give permission for him to do so, can understand why roman would want the freehold but as a counter who would of though a club like leeds would of had to sell their ground? until our finances are ship shape id not be inclined to sell to him yet, he gets us financially level and gets the wage bill under control before that as other wise we are still at risk (no matter how small)"
"The majority of reasons for the CPO existing no longer exist, if they basically block the building of the new stadium then they hold the club to ransom and become what they once defeated. "
But why would Roman spend hundreds of millions on a new stadium which he would end up not owning?

Well the reason Battersea was an option because the Bridge couldn't be re-developed. Funny how things change isn't it?
"Thing is this entire thread will be pointless, there will be no new stadium, if CPO now decide they dont actually want to sell the shares under any condition"
"He/club will own the stadium he/club just wont own technically speaking own the patch of mud under it, the cpo is abit complicated in that manner as the club and cpo kind of jointly own the stadium just in unequal bits."
"Its a moot point tbf, because the new stadium wont be built if CPO now decide they have a whole new set of objections"
No one knows what Roman will or wont do regards the new ground & CPO.

"None knows for sure what will happen if he gets knocked back by cpo, although I might add that if he was willing to build new stadium but then backed out because of cpo then I might be a little suspicious as to why, I mean its a seemingly commonly held thought that roman intends on passing down the club to his sons at some point so is committed longterm as far as we are aware, if this is the case having the freehold should be inconsequential really, end of the day a possible reason to want the club lock stock is so that he has a higher bargaining chip if he decided to sell one day? 1b worth of land (if he was to redevelop himself and make all profit himself) is a mighty big bargaining chip in negotiating when selling on in the future and would essentially of put himself in position of owning a top 5/10 club in world football for nothing."

"Again, rehashing old arguments is pointless but I thought it showed a tremendous lack of faith in a man who had done so much for this club and I say that as a CPO shareholder with family who also have them. When you look at where we were under Bates, it's arguable that Roman saved us from going down the same route as Leeds yet people didn't trust him."
"Anyone know what's the latest on the new stadium? Planning application, objections, etc. just hoping I'm around long enough to see it happen."

^ My post above. 
"Have just found this. Posted in early March. The developers of Earl's Court have apparently criticised Chelsea's planning application for the re-development of Stamford Bridge. I'm not sure what he has to do with them. I would imagine that there may only be problems for residents, businesses etc if the two redevelopments were taking place at the same time but I'm sure that Hammersmith and Fulham and Kensington and Chelsea Councils are considering the impacts of the two re-developments. I'm not sure when the re-development of Earl's Court is to finish. Having lived and worked in London for more years than I care to remember I've seen a number of re-developments been done together in a small area: you only have to look at the Square Mile i.e. City of London."

Big news coming out of Parkhead.  They are going to go with a safe standing/railed seating area.
Big news coming out of Parkhead.  They are going to go with a safe standing/railed seating area.
"I think the likelihood is the club have worked on the fact that the cpo wont sell and that they wont own the lease on any new development, they would be better off going for the lease (if they still plan to) after they have built the new ground, they are 10x more likely to get the vote after plowing the money in and seeing the fruits of the redevelopment than they are prior to the diggers going in."
Big news coming out of Parkhead.  They are going to go with a safe standing/railed seating area.
"At one of the presentations last year I asked about safe standing and was told that there were no plans to install it but given what's happening at Parkhead it sets a precedent and hopefully Chelsea will do the same. Won't affect the plans too much and won't affect the capacity of the ground. I guess the discussion will be about how many people can stand. Say 6,000 which will be 10% of total capacity."
Adding standing room would increase the capacity no? More people can stand in an area than sit
"Think I've got this right, sorry if already posted, but Celtic's new stadium plan shows an area of safe standing. "
I guess it all depends on how the standing area is set-up. If they do what happens in German grounds and will happen at Parkhead the standing areas can be converted into seating areas by using rail type seats. I think that under UEFA rules that standing areas have to be converted into seating areas for European matches.
Surely the CPO wont block this
"Of course we wont, me personally though(as ive explained before) will not give up my CPO even when the new ground is completed, its our safety net & long may that continue."

Always wanted to be a construction QS.
"1000 bricks a day also, you'd need to find some brickies like this "
"You would make a terrible QS. You've completely ignored Monday being much less for bricks laid due to more visits to the toilet after the standard Sunday night vindaloo. Then Friday afternoons are a write off as plans for the weekend are made. Wednesday will be a slow day, it's when you pick your weekend bets and go to the bookies to put them on. Thursday is slowing down for the weekend day. So that leaves Tuesday as the work day."
"1000 bricks a day also, you'd need to find some brickies like this"
I once knew a man (drank himself to an early death) who claimed to be able to lay a thousand bricks per day.
That was Freddie Mercury. I think you misheard him.

The FA's 'favourites' have been given Wembley while Three points lane is being redeveloped...
Craven cottage it is for us then lol
It's not a case of Spurs being 'favourites'. They are simply way ahead of us in every aspect of their stadium build. We have so much to do before a brick is even laid.
I'd rather Craven Cottage over Wembley. What a sh*t area/journey that is. 
"The problem with Craven Cottage is despite it being local, it's so small it can barely accommodate our present season ticket holders. If the club faced shutting out club members for three years it would be a financial blow in the short term as what would be the point of paying £25 when there is literally no chance of getting a ticket? Then the longer term effects could also be bad as it may take some time to repair that damage. I'm sure the club will see the benefits of at least a 50K capacity stadium as they need to grow the match going support to hope to eventually fill a 60K Stamford Bridge."
I've been hearing that this plan might not work with us not being given the green lights to build over the rail track. 
Given we have heard nothing for a while that makes sense. I can see us looking at new sites again.

Just put some pics up in the vintage section of the designs for our proposed new ground in the early 70s.
Isnt this contradictory. If not getting tickets for 2-3 seasons will turn someone to another team then I doubt that person would be willing to travel all the way across london.
"What I meant by hardcore support is the fans who travel away and long term season ticket holders. The fans that might lose some interest in going to games by being barred from getting tickets for three years are club members who pay £25 for the opportunity to get tickets for games, usually the less glamorous fixtures. And a lot of those fans aren't necessarily resident in SW6. So travelling to Wembley for 3 or 4 games a season would maybe not be as much a problem to them as being frozen out for three seasons. It's perhaps not they'd support someone else, just that they may lose the habit or drive in that time and not get back into it."
"We have 25,000 non cooperate season ticket holders. If we go to craven cottage who decides who loses their season ticket? Non starter for me."
Minutes of the CPO Board Meeting of 7 April 2016. I can't remember if they have already been posted. Point 2 is about the ground redevelopment
Have just found this article about the redevelopment. 
Have just found this article about the redevelopment. 
"Objections now posted on the RBKC website too, dated 1st August (just search for 'Stamford Bridge' and look under the Decisions tab)"
Thanks for posting Kiwi1691.
"Valencia have been building their new stadium for 9 years now and are still nowhere near completion, hope we don't end up waiting that long."
Have found a couple of links about the redevelopment. Don't think they've been posted before. Apologies if they have. One is from about a year ago and is from the Greater London Authority (GLA). The GLA has called the redevelopment of the Bridge Project Neptune.

"Reading that I was thinking this would be tied up in planning for some time yet, however the last line seems to indicate we've addressed their additional request."
Fukin bats!!!!!
More regulations about them then anything else...drives you batty...best not get into a flap about it though eh?
i think our children will be fine not knowing a dirty flying rat did exist
Who remembers this little chap?
michy only been here a few weeks and already he's causing issues. the longer we're not in wembley stadium the better imo. one thing i hope which is a hard ask is we can win the champion's league one last time at stamford bridge before the new stadium move. what a dream that would be.

	Just found the following on the Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham Council website. One is about a resident in Seagrave Road which is just around the corner from the ground. The other is a letter to a representative of the club with some questions about the redevelopment proposal.

	Kev56, thanks for letting me know that the documents are no longer available. Strange that the Council has just removed them given that they were put on the website about two months ago. The documents do include personal information i.e. home addresses so I wonder if that has been spotted. Anyway, I have managed to download the documents to my laptop. Hope to upload them to here later today. Will remove personal references out of courtesy to the residents. Also to stop this website from getting into trouble about data protection etc.

			I have tried accessing the links I posted a few days ago a few times this morning. Sometimes I can access the links and on other times I can't.

"
	It would be great to have an area for standing at the re-built Bridge. When the club did presentations last year about the proposed re-development a number of people asked if there were plans to have a standing area and the answer was no. But things can change in a year.
"
"
			So we're not planning on ignoring current stadium regulations when we build the new stadium.
		"
"
			I don't really get how standing can be illegal in the top two English divisions, but okay in the lower divisions and in Scotland. Are those fans somehow more trustworthy or less in need of protection?

	So is there any recent developments on the consideration of the plan by the council? I can't remember when they said we can roughly expect a decision on the plan.

	Some of the gate designs:
"
"
@kiwi1691 Thanks for posting the pictures. Some great designs. My favourite is Carefree since 1905.

	Prefer the 1st design but with STAMFORD BRIDGE since 1905 rather than Chelsea & Carefree since 1905 that sounds & looks naff imo

	The first gate is nicest, with the club logo. Though maybe instead of ""carefree since 1905"" just a simple ""Est. 1905"" ?

	Wherever we go while the reconstruction is happening, we must avoid Wembley at all cost's. More money maybe, but with the tv deals and new sponsorship we have enough. Every team will see a chance to play at Wembley as a massive massive game, also we have seen with Arsenal and now Spurs in the CL it also feels more like a neutral game for the ""home"" team too.

	Theres no other viable alternative for grounds outside of Wembley unfortunately.
"
"
	I'm afraid Wembley is the strong option. Our record there isn't too bad and if we go to Reading or MK I can't see us being a very attractive option for any potential signings. It's not ideal but we have to make the most of it and make it our home. Didn't Arsenal use the old Wembley? The new Wembley is much better and I'm not convinced Tottenham would have played better at WHL, the champions league isn't their thing after all. The only problem may be that Tottenham could still be there if their ground doesn't come in on time. As long as we had it fumigated after they leave we will be fine. I live very near Twickenham and would love that to happen but not sure why others have discounted this option.

			If they allow rail standing in the premier league it will not change capacity. Each ticket will still have a designated seat.

	Just found this on the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC) Council website. It is date 19 December. Even though the planning application was submitted to London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham (LBHF) Council LBHF passed on copies to RBKC for comment etc. I'm not surprised given that the ground is on the border of the two councils.

			This was another couple of ideas I came up with:
			 
		"
"
	Bringing up old ground here, but i still struggle with Chelsea's claim that they cant add an extra tier to the MH upper because of local residents right to flight(i was told that at the two consultations i went to) firstly there isnt any properties behind the MH stand & the West stand is opposite the Oswald Stoll building & doesnt block out any light.

		"
"
	750 individual neighbouring windows were tested for the impact on light levels the new stadium will have (one of the reasons these developments in built-up areas take so much longer) according to the planning documents. These drawings show the difference in bulk and proximity to neighbouring properties between the old and new stadiums.
"
"
	Location of the various gates and public access times to the proposed new stadium.
"
"
			I can't see this happening, there's too many permutations, and too much red tape. Hope I'm wrong though. I like Stamford Bridge as it is, my only gripe is the position of the away fans. They get to much influence from there. 
		"
"
			I hope we put them high in the new West or East stand as that way they would have the least possible influence on the game. However, given that these would be the most expensive seats its very unlikely to happen and so hopefully they are in the West or East Lower. It irritates me that they have a corner of the Shed, all thanks to José Mourinho as well. 
		"
"
	Our away fans are up there with the best in the country, our home fans aren't so great TBH. If they are going to be located in a similar position to which they're now, then I think  they should be thinly spread in each 3 tiers,similar to what city have done. 
"
"
			As a regular away fan, I totally disagree about visiting supporters being shunted up in the gods.  These are the loyalist of fans and it's like an admission of defeat by the home support that they cannot out-sing them.  We should be better than that 
		"
"
			Fair point mate. I actually go to a handful of aways and in fairness do always appreciate being in the corner of an end, be it upper or lower. It just rankles me that the away fans get up to half the Shed when this is the stand that has been synonymous with our fans or decades. In the new ground they will definitely be in an end, just remains to be seen which one and why. I would have thought the Shed as this is easier to get in and out of. 
		"
"
			Is anyone else concerned about what 3 years at a half-full Wembley will do to us? It's been shown that the big pitch doesn't do any favours for teams that play there and for the fans the area is rubbish as well. 
		"

		"
"
			On the plus side, theres a lot more pubs suited for pre-match boozing around Wembley
		"
"
			There are properties on Brompton Park Crescent behind the MH Stand and a larger stand there would presumably have to be taller and stretch much further back. I do see your point about the proximity of the West Stand and Oswald Stoll but maybe it's a matter of where the sun is in relation to the stadium over the course of the year.

	Twickenham is more difficult to get to, the only realistic way of getting there is by train, and it is quite out of central London. Wembley on the other hand has more options to get there, several tube lines, overground and rail, and it is thus closer to central London. Also, Wembley is 8000 seats bigger than Twickenham, so if we don't sell out Wembley, chances are that we don't either sell out Twickenham.

	Assuming H&F Planners have covered all the bases then yes I agree there would be little reason to apply for a JR or Public Inquiry but there are always those vexatious litigants who like to delay and hold up schemes just to get their their moment of glory and make a point. Delay is probably the best any JR could hope to achieve. I'm thinking for example about the stadium featuring in the sight-lines of St Pauls from Richmond Park. That's been a cause célèbre in the media recently recently and it's something seemingly innocuous like that can be exploited and trip you up. Hopefully we get an overwhelming approval from the planners and the Club continues to work with the neighbours to smooth over any concerns.

	Is it still going to be called Stamford Bridge? Because I will struggle to call it anything else. Especially if it ends up being some bollocks like the Yokohama Tyres Stadium.

	I'd say the club will push on with this now ASAP, they've wanted this project, either at the Bridge or elsewhere to happen for sometime now so theres no point holding back.

	This is incredibly exciting! Cant wait to go there when it is all done
"

			Pity we couldn't push it up tp 65 to 70k capacity, we'll need that in 5 years.
		"
"Yeah would seem a bit of a false economy if all we can ever have is 60,000 and no more ever ! They must be planning for this. The design does look complicated and not exactly modular looking though !"
"
	My worry would be if we could fill a 70 plus thousand stadium every other week?
	 
"
"
	Maybe not now, but in the future I dont see why not. As long as we remain within title fights etc we will always pull crowds. 
"
"
	We've struggled to sell out Stamford Bridge for cup games and Champions League qualifiers, so talk of anything greater than 60k seems pretty unrealistic to me. I reckon we'll sell out every League game at the new ground but there will be empty seats for the other competitions, unless we are playing a big rival/club.
"
"
	As noted, this whole debate is academic because we won't ever have a bigger capacity than 60,000 due to the size of the Stamford Bridge plot and the potential impact on our neighbours. The only conceivable exception to that is if safe standing is legalised and we're allowed to squeeze in a couple of thousand additional fans but the overall effect will be minimal. 
"
"
			Fairly sure it's in the plan to sell the naming rights.  Bound to happen to almost every club in the world.  I've made peace with that decision, will always be Stamford Bridge to me.
		"
"
	What will the new stadium do for ticket prices? West Ham's increased capacity has meant a reduction, but obviously they got their stadium for pittance.

	The design of the new stadium is truly outstanding. No other stadium design in the country focuses so much on being this aesthetically pleasing or dare I say stylish from the outside. Old Trafford looks like a cobbled together bunch of steel sheds, and both the north London club stadiums come up short compared to this. The new Stamford Bridge, because that is what it is and will always be called, is far superior to the emirates and the new WHL. Their stadiums have a lower quality build. This really will set Chelsea Football Club aside from other clubs and give the club a much stronger identity both in this country and on an international scale. The stronger identity will encourage more fans and better players for decades to come and as a fan I welcome this huge leap forward in the clubs development.
"
"
	Just some of the things the architects had to contend with.   Various Conservation Areas, Listed Buildings and Monuments,  Nature Conservation Sites, Buildings of Local Merit and protected views from Richmond Park to St.Paul's Cathedral.   Add to that a high number of well heeled local residents. you've got to say they did an exceptional job.
"
"
			Coincidently, there is another significant meeting being held tonight.   Councillors representing the London Borough of Brent wards surrounding Wembley Stadium are discussing a proposal by the Football Association to increase full capacity events at the stadium to 57 per year.    This is surely with both Spurs and likely Chelsea playing there in mind.
		"
"
			Do we know the outcome of this meeting yet?
		"
"
	Loving the design it will be the best looking ground by far. Any ideas when it will be finished.

	Based on everything I have seen, this new stadium will be an iconic football pitch for years to come. I think once complete, it will be something everyone will be proud of for sure. It is not the sterile stadium such as Emirates or the new White Hart Lane that lack character.

	Its a shame the local MP for Notting Hill Gate doesnt feel the same when 1,000s of people piss up, have a bunk up, do drugs, commit violent crimes on peoples doorsteps & gardens during the music festival every year, football fans though absolute animals.
"
"
	I wonder if the MP is referring to Twickenham not being used for non-Rugby Union events/matches. I say that as Twickenham has twice been used for the Rugby League Challenge Cup Final (last time in 2006) and a few months ago a game of American Football was played there. There are plans to play games of American Football at Twickenham this year. See below. Concerts have also taken place at Twickenham. I don't recall any objections to those. Correct me if I'm wrong.

	The new images of WHL aren't very appealing, in my opinion. If I didn't know i's their new stadium, my guess would be it's some generic stadium they built in the Middle East or Asia for an event like the Olympics. It's not bad per se, but it has no character whatsoever. But it's easier to build and so they'll have a bigger stadium sooner which is a bit annoying. I hope our management will put a rush on it.
"
"
	I am just very glad .........that Stamford Bridge is going to remain as the home of Chelsea football club.
"
"
	The pitch is planned to be only marginally bigger than the present one.   Two metres longer and half a metre wider.  That would give pitch dimensions of 105m x 68m, the unofficial standard size that most top stadiums now have.

			This meeting involved a presentation by the Football Association as part of the consultation process.  Brent Council expects them to make a formal application in the next week or two.  What with Spurs moving in next season, they seem to have left this quite late.

	Chairman's Statement from this morning's CPO AGM:
"
"
			Not really news as such but first hand confirmation of what has been posted previously. One of the residents of the Shed End flats has been told by Fordstam that he doesn't have to move out until the end of the 2017/18 season as building work won't be starting until then. 
			You will remember that the first phase of the build involves knocking down those flats (while the club remains playing at the ground for a season). This seems to confirm that the club will move out - to Wembley presumably - for the 19/20, 20/21 and 21/22 seasons with the new ground opening for 2022/23.

	So how much cashish are these measly extra 20,000 seats going to generate for us?

		"

	Wish we could have crammed in an extra 10k. Does anybody think we will change the tunnels, maybe build them underground? Really wanna see a wider tunnel. 
"
"
			So whats that about £40m per season, x10 years = (£400m) almost the price of the whole stadium(£500m) paid for in 10 years, just from the extra revenue from those 20k seats. Probably quicker depending on the rate of price increase on those seats in the future.
		"
"
			We don't play 40 home games a season.

		"
"
			Lets say we play 19 prem homes games, 4 cup games and 5 European games, that's about 28 home games.
		"
"
			Again, you are wildly exaggerating. I really don't think those 20 000 extra spectators will spend an extra £50 each EVERY game. Say I took my son, that would mean I'd spend £100 per game ON TOP of the £100 I spend on tickets. By your maths, going to the Bridge would cost me £5600  (28 x £200) (about a quarter of the average net income in the UK), before I'd spent a penny on transport.
		"
"
	Its quite simple guys.
	Arsenal have a match day revenue per season of around £100m, we have a match day revenue per season of around £70m. Our new stadium will likely match Arsenal's revenue for match day income. 
	So an extra £30m per season. 
	Take away costs and you are looking at £10m-20m per season but those will be offset by any sponsorship deal we enter into which will probably be around £10m-£15m per season.
	irrelevant really though about when the stadium has paid for itself. The stadium is to secure our future and cement our place among the top table. The stadium is also - I thought - ultimately a gift from RA to Chelsea and the club will be given to his son upon completion. It isn't a loan like Arsenal had which hampered their progress for a number of years as they sought to be profitable.

	The biggest draw of these new stadiums are the guys who 3 and 4 figures per game to sit in the corporate and hosptality seating. I had a mate from Ireland who for 6 years had a corporate seating in one of the suites for himself and his father costing about £2,500 each a year. The new stadium will increase the amount of ""fat cats"" in the stadium and a lot of these seats costs 10 times what a regular seat is.

	The English based support is there to fill it. Plus the tourist interest in coming to London to watch a game is strong whilst we are successful. Only about 6000 tickets are for sale for a home game if the away allocation is 3,000. So if we have in the region of 50,000 plus? Members. The extra tickets should be bought, also driving away touts as it will be easier to get a ticket.

	Thanks Boyne. Surprising and interesting prediction about those ST holders. Was anything mentioned about the statistics for the Spurs ST holders?

	Maybe the reason 23% of sts wont renew while we play elsewhere is because the average age of our home support is now 55, by the time the ground is finished some of those fans could be thinking about slowing down by then & not having to mess around with crap kick off times etc

			Good point CB. I read a few months ago that Chelsea has the eldest average for home support. And leaving Wembley is a pain in the arse. Leaving there at about 10pm would mean people arriving home very late. Me and the people I go the games with are all in our fifties and sixties. When I see them at the next game I'll ask them if they are going to renew when we and if we go to Wembley.

			As for the VWR it is a joke. Am fortunate that as ST holder I usually don't have a problem buying a ticket for non-Premier league home game. But having tried to buy tickets for away games it is a pain in the arse. It would help if when you accessed the ticket page on the website you knew where you were in the queue and how long you would have to wait. I used to work with a Spurs ST holder and he told me that when he tried to buy a ticket he was told where he was in the queue and how long he would have to wait. I think I'll write to the club and ask why we can't do the same at Chelsea.

			Nothing to do with the stadium but show's how much the area and pubs are changing.
		"
"
			Some of the pubs round the ground have changed a lot in the last few years. It will be interesting to see how many more change in the next few years before and while we move to a temporary stadium. Before and after the game we sometimes go to the Atlas in Seagrove Road or to the Blackbird or Courtfield in Earl's Court Road. The Atlas is a great pub. Sometimes drink in the Wetherspoons pub in Victoria Station.
		"
"
			I find the Atlas a bit pricey, nice pub but a bit poncy for me to use for a football day out. 
		"
"
			Agree about it's depressing about the pubs in the area. Used to get into the Lillie on occasions. Have been there a couple of times since Pat and Mary retired and it's changed beyond recognition. And expensive as well. 
		"
"
			If you know an area vaguely or even pretty well not just in London and meet someone from there you can guarantee that every pub you mention will have been knocked down especially pubs that were on or near estates. A pub for me is not £5 a pint and serving lamb in a red wine jus with couscous.

	By the time we actually move in to the re-built bridge i'll be mid 50s & some of my mates touching 70!
"
"
	Oh for goodness sake. I dont even care anymore. Delays upon delays. Out of the top 6 clubs we have the smallest stadium. And you know what? Who cares. 41K capacity stadium it is for us and I don't mind it. By the time we move to our new stadium Spurs and Arsenal will be looking to increase their capacity to 70k. We will always be playing catch up. Regarding stadiums, I've lost interest now. I'd rather us be competitive on the pitch. 
"
"
	IMO the exterior of the stadium is irrelevant. What is important is the interior and how everything is constructed. From the dugouts to the stands to pitch. Latest technology, innovation everything needs to be included in the new stadium if they are taking this long to make it. Capacity is irrelevant since it will mostly be corporate seats anyway that will increase. But the actual layout and aesthetics needs to be top class, best in England. 
"
"
	So if these local residents get 3,000 seats then really the majority of the capacity increase won't be for supporters. Can't imagine then that the atmosphere will get any better in the slightest. That's about 12 - 13,000 seats that won't be going to serious supporters. Those people will be as productive to the atmosphere as empty seats so, at best, there's gonna be at 48 - 47,000 of us. It's going to be a tough 4 years wherever we go.
"
"
			To be fair it needs to be awesome inside and out. You don't build these every year. People go to see Sydney operahouse without any interest to opera.
			I think the design (of the new SB) is good but not unique.

	Liverpool close to pushing ahead with further epansion beyond 60k.

	Linking the debates on pubs and the 3,000 tickets for locals, I think some people, even Chelsea fans are not quite aware just how many council and housing association estates there are in the vicinity of the stadium.   It's often thought as a 'well to do' area and sure enough, there has been much gentrification over the years exemplified by the aforementioned gastro-pub.   We do mourn the loss or change of many a once favourite boozer.  But when you visit other clubs, you realise we are still very well catered for, compared to others.   Some pubs and bars have shut but others have opened.   If looking for what might be a no frills but 'proper football pub' there are still ones located near those housing estates.  Haven't been there for a while but 'Rileys' on the King's Road was always decked out in blue.  There's the 'Queen Elizabeth' down Bagley's Lane which is the Pearscroft Estate's local.  £3.60 for a pint of Carling in there and in a proper glass too.  'The Goose' up North End Road as well.  'The Chelsea Pensioner'  is nicely festooned with CFC flags on matchdays.

	Build backwards- two huge cantilever ends.

	In theory no problem yet do we have the space and also thought we were looking at least at 10k more seats. By increasing the depth of the North and South stands could we get an extra 10K?

			In theory no problem yet do we have the space and also thought we were looking at least at 10k more seats. By increasing the depth of the North and South stands could we get an extra 10K?
		"
"
	Another way of raising capacity...
"
"
			Realistically the only way of reaching the magic 60,000 would be to go for Borussia Dortman type ends- which aren't actually cantilevered, go back forever, to the point that the seats at the very rear are about as close to pitch as watching from the back of the old Shed.
		"
"
	Assuming we increase from 42000 capacity to about 60000, and that we fill that every week. That's an extra 18000 seats per game. Average ticket price probably about £70 these days? So that's £1.26 million more per week income from tickets. 19 home games in a season, so that's a minimum of £24m more per year (plus more for european/cup games). Let's call that about £30m a year.
"
"
	If we don't increase the stadium will that impact future cub growth through membership, as younger fans won't get a look in.

"
	Also think about normal seat with hospitality. A friend had a seat in the old directors box known he as the Di Matteo suite. 3 course meal your seat and buffet after the game, this now costs over 10 grand!! There are cheaper options all the way along East middle and the tier below Abramovich in the the West. Look at the range available on a match basis in the ticket section online.
"
"
	It's just a shame we're in the most popular and congested area of London. Just shows how limited for space London is when you compare to Madrid, Rome etc where all the like of Roma and Atletico have built/in the process of building new stadiums. However, saying that, Juventus is one of the smaller stadiums in Italy isn't it?

		"
"
			That's so true and the other problem with London is partly the high number of clubs and that they are tied to such specific areas. Cities like Rome and Madrid and Manchester too are really only two club cities, so they can move almost anywhere and still be Rome, Madrid or Manchester. If we move more than half a mile in any direction it's almost the same effect of a Manchester club moving to Liverpool.

	You are very probably correct regarding the practicalities of squeezing 60,000 backsides into a limited space, however I get the impression that the powers that be wanted a start from scratch landmark design, rather than a hotchpotch one stand at a time affair ala Man Utd, which houses 70,000 plus.

	Whilst I'm all for the new build in principle, my biggest worry is what it may cost in football terms. The reported 3 or 4 years at Wembley(?) could prove disastrous on the field. Four years of that will take more than 20'000 extra seats to rectify.
"
"
	It’s difficult to predict what may happen in football terms, but I’m sure when the new stadium is up and running, we’ll attract even more top players to the capital.

			This is very worrying for me. The atmosphere is already not exactly the best at SB, but with over a quarter of the seats being hospitality, it's going to be even worse. We make fun of the lack of atmosphere at places like the emirates, but I can forsee this new stadium being worse.

	I think Bates has to take a lot of the blame for this the Shed only holding 6,000 so he could build the hotel was ridiculous. On the other hand Bates was originally on the committee for the new Wembley and he did recognise the amount of flats and businesses that could be built around the stadium. I can't remember what was at Wembley apart from the stadium a car park and some waste ground.

	That's great news!!!! Extra land means there is a possibility of expanding the capacity to 65k rather than 60k. 70k would be a bit too good to be true since I assume the land will be mostly used to facilitate entry and exit from the stadium.

			He had no idea how ticket prices would shoot up along with crowds during the 90s. Back then hardly anyone was getting weekly attendances of 40000.

I want to believe that additional free areas will allow to rebuild the northwestern corner of the stadium because the third tier in the corner looks small and flawed. I hope the capacity will increase to 65 thousand spectators, and this will be more than that of Totenham and Arsenal and will bring more money for the club.

			The problem is our building application will have specified the capacity, any changes to that or the structural design will mean a reapplication and having to go through processes again, peer reviews etc. That would add a hell of a lot of time to the build.

			I'll have to take your word on that, as I know zero about planning stuff. But i can imagine Roman wanting a bigger stadium with more seats, like having the biggest boat, sexiest wife, best club in London.....just wish he wanted the best players like the old days.

			So whats that about £40m per season, x10 years = (£400m) almost the price of the whole stadium(£500m) paid for in 10 years, just from the extra revenue from those 20k seats. Probably quicker depending on the rate of price increase on those seats in the future.

	This is controversial and perhaps I'm overly dejected about the current state of the Club, Antonio Conte's future etc...But I'm genuinely beginning to wonder whether there is any real sense in building this new stadium. Obviously, CFC would make more matchday revenue from ticket sales, megastore purchases etc, but that's becoming less relevant season after season given the gargantuan tv deals and corporate sponsorships which the clubs receive. Also, I'm beginning to wonder if the Club's relative frugality in the transfer market these days is directly linked to the future financing of the new stadium. It seems like Abramovich's plans for the stadium are very expensive and as a result we can no longer compete for the elite players in the market; We are clearly falling behind Man United and Man City in this sense, and I worry that what happened to Arsenal from 2006-2012 could easily happen to us if there were large debts which would need to be repaid. Lastly, as a current Season Ticket Holder, I think spending 3 seasons at Wembley/The London Stadium would be truly awful in so manys ways and I fear that our core, matchgoing support would diminish at a faster rate than it currently is at the moment. 
"
"
	We can compete if/when the club want to. Sure Neymar is out of the equation but we just spent 70m on Morata and seemed like we were also willing to spend another 70m on Sandro. The days of simply outbidding competition are probably over but thats also down to the lavish sums a handful of clubs can somehow manage to outlay every season. 
"
"
	I also have a gut feeling that the new stadium will end in tears.

			I love the idea of the new stadium but I have my concerns. However, more than whether we will be able to compete with Manchester teams in transfer money spent, I am more worried about the capacity to fill it with supporters. Other than the obvious London and top 4 rivals, I am watching empty seats in many games, for example the Bournemouth match and there were still tickets available yesterday for the West Brom game on Monday, and there are still tickets for the Hull FA Cup. How are we going to sell out a Stamford Bridge with much larger capacity?

	Reading through earlier posts about the acquisition of nearby properties/land around Stamford Bridge. I would rather they utilise that bit of land to increase leg room or depth so that it is more comfortable to walk in and around the stands than increase the number seats/capacity. Since I saw a few numbers suggesting minimal leg room compared to other modern stadia due to how cramped and contained SB is thanks to its location.

	If Chelsea want to be considered a big team, we're going to have to expand the Bridge.
"
"
	I’m with you on this. I’ve dreamt of this new stadium since he 70’s. We must keep up or get left behind. It’s more than a stadium, it’s a statement of intent to move forward. A modern, iconic London landmark. Can’t wait.

	The design seems to divide opinion but I would honestly prefer our design, a design that is forged into the very limited space we have, than a copy and paste metal bowl that you see the world over now a days.

Chelsea kicks off search for stadium buildersBy Louise Dransfield, Dave Rogers 13 February 2018Premier League club’s new stadium will have 60,000 capacity when builtChelsea has begun the hunt for the first contractors to get involved with building work at the £1bn redevelopment of its Stamford Bridge ground.The first tranche of work is expected to include the decking platforms to be built over the District Line to the north west of the stadium and a mainline railway used by Southern trains to the east.These platforms will be used to help create the areas for fans to mill about outside the new ground which has been designed by Herzog & de Meuron, the Swiss architect behind the Tate Modern extension.A winner is expected to be announced by the middle of the year.Last month, the west London club headed off a legal threat to its 60,000 seat development after Hammersmith and Fulham Council sided with it amid a row with neighbouring residents who complained the project would block their daylight.The Premier League team’s current capacity is 41,600 and the new ground will mean its capacity will be on a par with Arsenal’s Emirates stadium but behind Spurs’ 61,559 when its new ground, being built by Mace, completes this August.The wider project team includes Arcadis as cost manager, WSP as transport consultant with the firm also providing engineering services along with German structural engineer Schlaich Bergermann which has worked on stadia at the last three World Cups.Chelsea has been contacted for comment.

	If and when we get going on this, is it possible in this day and age to have a fixed construction price and a late finish penalty built into the building contract. Only asking because I remember the epic building of the east stand.
"

			In all seriousness I don't know how it would work. If Romans money was frozen the club would be in real trouble. There is no precedent for this type of thing but if cash stopped flowing would the club would still belong to Roman? Could the Government sell the club? I suspect it would be real trouble if they tried and all sorts of legal wrangling would ensue. If it did happen though and Roman was proved to be in receipt of ""dirty money"" the club would probably have to be self funding and the stadium project would hit the buffers.

	Interesting quote from the Chelsea fancast
"

	Wembley is already signed and sealed, with an agreement to open the Chelsea Nike store at Wembley. Could be 4/5 seasons.
"
"
	Not particularly applicable to this thread, but it's been announced that West Brom's application for a 3,600 safe standing area, consisting of "" rail seats"", has been rejected by the government.
"
"
	That is a shame. Maybe one day they'll realise we need safe standing...
"
"
	Safe standing would benefit clubs such as Everton, Liverpool and Spurs far more than us, because their stadiums, or proposed stadiums, feature a kop end, which would effectively become one big terrace, much like Dortmund's. Sadly we won't be so lucky, through nobody's fault, those are just the constraints of our site.

	Out of interest...if fans knew cost of rebuilding Stamford Bridge would lead to several years of mediocrity (just fighting for top four like Arsenal) and selling to buy in the transfer market, would they accept that? or would some now prefer ease and speed of a new build elsewhere, to be competitive with the likes of City asap?

"
			Not convinced that we can't build the stadium and remain competitive. If we stopped selling top prospects and wasting money on mediocrity then we should remain as challengers. 
		"
"
	I have already convinced myself that we will have 5 or 6 lean years from here. For me top 4 and a few cup runs is the only achievable aim for the next while until the stadium is built and paid for. Anything on top of that is a bonus (maybe even getting the first targets will be a bonus!)
"
"
	I confess I don't understand the £1bn price tag for a stadium rebuild that will only add 19,000 extra seats.
"

	I will make the club more attractive for fans to attend, and also a very cool environment for players to play in.

	The main thing about the new stadium, no matter how it divides opinion, we're going to get 60k, we're staying at home and we're going to be able to compete with other sides that have similar sizes stadiums in term of match day revenue, an area we're getting absolutely smashed on the balance sheets by a number of clubs.
"
"
	Genuinely think it will be the best looking stadium in the world. The brick and archways are very atmospheric. The asymmetric design is unique albeit out of necessity. Stunning bit of architecture, and infinitely more appealing than a soulless concrete bowl.

Severfield sounded out about Chelsea's Stamford Bridge rebuildBy Dave Rogers24 April 2018Severfield has been sounded out about the steelwork contract at the scheme to rebuild Chelsea’s Stamford Bridge ground.The firm, which is currently on site completing work on a £50m deal at the new home of Tottenham Hotspur, said it had been approached for its input into the scheme.Chief executive Alan Dunsmore said the job was currently projected to use around 6,000 tonnes of steel – less than half the amount being used on the Spurs’ 61,000 seat stadium.Severfield has a strong track record in carrying out work for high-profile Premier League clubs recently, having completed the steelwork on the main stand expansion at Liverpool’s Anfield ground nearly two years ago for main contractor Carillion.Dunsmore said: “We’ve been having discussions with Chelsea. If you look at Spurs, we were having conversations around that for five or six years before the tender came through.” Most of the steel used on the Chelsea job will be in the roof structure, Dunsmore added.Last week, Building revealed that the first major package on the £1bn redevelopment had gone to VolkerFitzpatrick which is set to carry out the enabling works contract which is centred on rail works and carries a pricetag of around £95m.The next major package set to be let is the deal to tear down the club’s existing ground. As well as demolition, the contract is expected to include excavation, basement and piling and substructure work.It is believed to have been talking to Multiplex, Lendlease, Mace and Sir Robert McAlpine about the main contractor role with an appointment due next year.The west London club wants to replace its existing 41,600 capacity ground with a 60,000 seat development that has been designed by Swiss architect Herzog & de Meuron, putting the capacity of the new ground on a par with Arsenal’s Emirates stadium.

		"
"
			The burden of proof required for a banning order isn't a lot.

I go regularly, but have never been in any kind of trouble, let alone close to getting banned...so these guys (or girls) must be doing SOMETHING? I am just asking what....
		"
"
			It looks like we will be at Wembley for the 3 (or 4) seasons away, and it's probably the only viable option. The only positive note for me is that I live down the road, but even then, I think it is a very bleak outlook for these years away from SW6. 
		"
"
			Wasn't there a rumour going around that we were going to explore the option of helping to develop Loftus Road or Craven Cottage (or maybe another stadium closer to Stamford Bridge) to get it up to around 30k and then ground share with them for 3/4 years whilst Stamford Bridge was being rebuilt?
		"
"
			For me, a ground share at Craven Cottage for the 3/4 years would be the ideal solution. 
		"
"
	I'd go out on a limb and suggest push comes to shove, for our tenure in Wembley we'll manage a higher average attendance than Spurs.
"
"
			I've personally witnessed someone being singled out by stewards for standing up- even though everyone else was standing- got slung out and had to appeal to keep hold his ST-   A middle aged mild mannered mate of mine refused entry for being drunk ( not and disorderly) - he was that irate he handed back his ST and vowed never to return.
		"
"
			A few people were done for standing on Sunday. There was always a guy with a down the front recording every time a steward approached a fan. While it was a bit ridiculous, these people didn’t really have a leg to stand on (obvious pun) by refusing to sit and should have just planted their asses in their seats. 
"
"
			I say this all the time but it would help if we could select our own seats, Man Utd are having a singing section at Wembley and a family section. Sorting out an area in the new stadium dedicated to this is very important & I hope the club listen since it's a good opportunity, something that isn't possible in the current stadium because you can't do it without moving season ticket holders.
		"
"

			You must let things go at certain times. 
		"
"
			I agree along with safe standing but mainly get them ‘orrible away fans out our shed and up in the gods!
		"
"
			That's the thing. I don't like sitting down but the people around me sat on Sunday so I did not enforce standing on them, I mean the guy in front of me was like 70. Nobody had a problem with me standing every now & then to sing and most behind me did the same.
			You must let things go at certain times. The atmosphere was pretty sh*t but I was not surprised. It works both ways: the people that want to sit all game could not chose their seat & nor could the more vocal that like to stand and thus you have a younger supporter sat next to/in front of a 80 year old that can’t stand all game. It doesn't take a genius to work out that you'd not get away with standing for the full 90.

	Interesting cautionary tale from Arsenal about Wenger and their experience with the stadium. The restriction on finances required to fund it in particular.
"
"
	Well it's happening, so better get used to it.
"
"
	Yeah we can't keep playing in a smaller stadium while others around us are expanding and building new ones. This is for the future of the club. 
"
"
	But borrowing north of 500m to fund it? The effort to pay that back might actually exceed the benefit as we've seen in Arsenal's case. They haven't been able to reinforce their squad and now ten years on they've slipped out of contention for titles and their team is in a such a sorry state, fans are staying away leaving empty seats in their new stadium.
"
"
	Just to add to this, a new stadium is projected to add around 30m of extra revenue for us.
"
"
			If Roman is funding it while the club pays for club operating costs okay, FFP means he can't invest much on the other side anyway.

			Football revenue has moved on massively from when Arsenal built the Emirates, teams are getting north of 100m now a days just for TV revenue. On the other hand, players wages and transfer fees have also sky rocketed but the correlation between Arsenal re-building then and us building now isnt as skewed, IMO.

	Wow well this is interesting.
"
"
	Fuccccckkkkk
"
"
	That's a big deal.
"
"
			That's a big deal.
		"
"
	That is NOT good at all
"
"
			Yep. Coupled with Roman MIA and no managerial appointment as of yet, things are looking Bleak House
		"
"
	Rumours flying round the web that the club is for sale !!
"
"
	I felt a bit sick hearing it. Just my emotions making me stupid probably but I feel there's more to this. Not good news at all.
"
"
	Could Roman finally be selling up?
"
"
			Could Roman finally be selling up?
		"
"
	f**k that's big news, and very bad news too. Really wonder what's going on.
"
"
	No doubt linked to RA's denied visa, where things go from here is anyone's guess.
"
"
			That is NOT good at all
		"
"
	If Roman is looking to sell, the potentially ruinous billion pound rebuild ticket would have put off most suitors.
"
"
			Fuccccckkkkk
		"

	If roman calls in the loan we're f**ked.

			he was never going to pay. there were going to be loans. i guess right now he is spitting his dummy out and CFC may well be on the receiving end
		"
"
			n﻿obody knows how much he was going to pay towards the stadium. he could have been open and willing to invest some of his own money into it. 
		"
"
			 
		"
"
	Interesting but understandable. Why invest your money in to the economy of a country that does not want you to be there?
"
"
	Ok fair enough, lets have some lolly for players then.
"
"
	Or could It be Roman wants to free up money to pay off conte, hire sarri and buy a bunch of players without the stadium hanging over his head?
"
"
	It is all about the football at the end of the day, the stadium can wait if we get back to challenging!
"
"
	He's got around the visa issue by becoming an Israeli citizen, he can enter the UK on a non-work visa anytime now, lets face it he aint looking to work like us lot, he just picks up the phone and tells his peeps what he wants- they do the work. So how can the home office prove he's working ? I would say its not the visa 'scaring' him off this project but whats potentially coming if the West's relations with the Kremlin sour even further, when push comes to shove hes gonna side with Putin, hence his new Tel Aviv bolthole.  Its a shame as this SB re development looked like a fantastic project, one I'd like to have got on, I'm on a 3 billion dollar one over here just starting up, so would have loved to try and blag my way on Roman's 'remodel' as a PM.

"
	I admit, i'm a bit concerned about where we are heading. This stadium was a big thing, something that has been planned for years by the club (this thread is 5 years old now) Roman Abramovich can't get a visa to work in this country, the issues with the coach still hasn't been sorted, it just seems like the club is on hold right now.
"
"
	Wishful thinking perhaps, but does this not seem like a negotiating stance Visa-wise?

	I am not massively fussed about this. 
"
"
	I wouldnt invest £1bn into a City/country where i am so far, being unable to work.  The minute they hand him his UK visa, itll be back on.  It's call my bluff.

"
	I think people will be disapointed if they think this news means we are going to spend big on players anytime soon.
"
"
	Looks very much like a standoff between Roman and the British Government. And given the current strength of anti-Russian feeling and activity, even a 1 billion pound building project isn't likely to have much sway.
"
"
	I think it's fine - it means we can all stop whining and moaning about the stadium, and how sh*t it is trying to get to Wembley, and concentrate on whining and moaning about the manager or our very own scapegoat player of choice.
"
"
	On a purely selfish note,no wembley,hooray !
"
"
	I dunno why anybody would rather we invest big amounts into the squad rather than build a new stadium. The stadia is for our future, the short term vision isn't good. I would much rather we build this new stadia and cut back on buying, and instead use a handful of our talented youngsters, both on loan and in the youth system. We could save about £100m, if not more, by using our younger players.
"
"
	I hope I'm right when I say this but the huge amount of money that's involved in this and the amount of money that has and will go into the economy in this country with Roman as our owner tells me that this could be resolved
"
"
	Well I guess we'll just have to be owned by an Israeli then  .    On a more serious note I think this is more than posturing, I think he has just got fed up with the entire headache of owning a club that is a daily circus, one that he created BTW.  His desire for 'Barcelona ' style football has eluded him, just as his desire to dominate English football, with the US billionaires and the Arab gizzillionaires now out spending him and buying up some of the most sought of players in the world. This, together with the Visa issue has just maybe put him over the edge and he wants to get shot of his headaches and invest elsewhere.   Will not be surprised if behind the scenes the club is being sold, hence no news coming out of the Boardroom on appointments or transfers; clearly he has been thinking about scrapping the new stadium for a while, those decisions are not made overnight in a fit of rage......anyway onward and upward on the Chelsea merry go round....it should be an interesting summer.  
"

	Whilst not great news, totally expected and sensible decision from Roman, Marina, et al.

	we all know his dosh was dodgy and that he was close to Putin yet we ignored it because we liked the success Chelsea were having.
"
"
	Would an Arab with funds on par with City be a bad thing? Even in the unlikely situation that this is the end of Abramovich, it certainly won't be the end of Chelsea. I'd be surprised if billionaires the world over wern't falling over their Hublot's to purchase a club in the most exclusive part of the best city in the world.
"

	Nothing is ever predictable or boring at Chelsea, which adds something extra to the club, but this is a worrying development!

	If the club transfers hands I don't think we'll get a better owner. Unless we get bought by a state like City/PSG. Hope this is all just a part of Roman's chess game.
"
"
	Interested to see if this impacts on the club's transfers. The narrative or speculation has been that the burden of building and  paying  for  the  stadium would  impact on our ability to fund transfers. Players Vs stadium so to speak. I wonder if free if those shackles and pressure if it helps loosen the purse strings to allow us to remain competitive in the short term?

	This is a standard part of project management, continued business justification. The business case is continually reviewed to ensure its aligned to the business objectives, at any point it can be stopped for review or totally cancelled. This can be down to anything from cost inflation in materials (and there's a f**k ton of material in this build) to a better alternative way of accomplishing those needs has been found.

		"
"
	We don't know how long the project is on-hold for. It could be 3 months, 1 year or 6 months. Don't see the reason to panic since there have been delays in getting approval from the council etc but there was no official announcement from the club back then so no one really payed much attention to the delays. This case may be more serious but still no need to overreact. It's not as if the project has been abandoned...... so the club still plan on continuing with it. Hence the word 'on-hold'.

		"
"
			we are two years or so away from losing all the European players who will then be classed as foreign instead of homegrown. we will then be down to three foreign players per team as premier league rules require 8 homegrown. but hey lets not let brexit get in the way of a good story :D
"

			Premier league requires 8 home grown players in a squad of maximum 25 players over the age of 21. To class as home grown you have to have trained in england/Wales for 3 years prior to age 21 irrespective of nationality.

			I agree that the timing of this news was inappropriate, but if has problems entering the country now (and chances are high that this may be a recurrent problem in the future), there's no point gambling 1 billion on a project that won't see immediate returns. A new stadium doesn't pay itself out in just a few years and 1 billion investment does NOT increase the club's value by 1 billion, if he were to sell the club sometime in the next few years. 
		"
"
			so interest rates are at the lowest for years and the product is considered the best available yet these are unfavorable conditions! yeah pull the other one!

			We was fairly substantially outbid for the site at Battersea from memory and I'm not sure the CPOs would have allowed it to happen.

			From memory i thought it was more a CPO issue. I'm sure a higher bid would still have cost less than the current redevelopment plan. "
"
			Maybe the timing wasn't that bad, they always say bury bad news on a big news day, and we released it an hour or so after Zidane resigned and lamps joined derby, so although in the news our stadium wasn't the big talking point it could of been if it was a quiet news day, club may of known of stadium for a while now, but were waiting for right time, just a thought, anyway we're still at bridge, for a few years now we worried we'd be moved, think of the pikies, I bet they'd love to be in our position, in my job, I see many a person with a f**king great house but not a pot to piss in, others with a fairly nice house but with money still to enjoy themselves, I know what I prefer, the bridge is fine as it is. One request though if we do a part upgrade in future, let's just knock shed down and put a big one tier stand there, and no away fans in there!!

	It’s funny saying that, considering he has poured millions and millions into the country. 
"
"
	It might be problematic only in the short-term but trying to buy any world-class player is already faced by a bit of a barrier when coming here because of a lack of top four; if this  issue    is potentially linked to    the problems with the UK Gov then a player who's world class might see it as a bit of a risk if theirs a lack of obvious stability / vision, esp. with a plethora of other clubs available. 
"

	for me and many others its the way he runs the club that is the issue not the amount of money he spends.

	Say what you like about Mears (he was a **** imho) but. Bates worked his ass off for years trying to save the club from dying!  Not a pot to piss in. Developers hovering over our heads. Slum stadium. Notorious, racist, scummy fans that turned a well liked club into a hated one. Attendance's falling to alltime lows. He (and the board) devised a longterm plan to bring in serious investment that would totally transform the club. He did just that and the rest is history!

		"
"
			IMO, Putin is an publicly acceptable front for the nationalist generals that wanted to protect Russia from balkanisation, I agree he made his money under Yeltzin and then Putin warned the oligarchs including Putin not to attack the state and support the state. Putin Abramovich then funded one of the Eastern provinces. They came to an arrangement I doubt that makes them friends more just respecting each others sphere's of influence.

Just to say before I carry on that unless Roman's visa situation is worked out to everyone's satisfaction - to the extent that he can secure investment for a large-scale development scheme - then none of what follows is feasible. And who knows how close he is to be able to get to that point? British-Russian relations continue to seem very frosty as things stand.Anyway, I know this was discussed a few months ago but I've been struck in recent days that some long standing Chelsea fans have once again been speculating about the possibility of the club scrapping the hugely expensive, hugely complex SB scheme and instead revisiting Earls Court as an alternative. The Earls Court development has reached a state of limbo with the demolition of the Exhibition Centre having taken place but no sign that building is due to start anytime soon on the main site (the Lillie Square development on Seagrave Road is proceeding but is only selling very slowly). The developer Capco was trying to relaunch the scheme with a new more intensive development (increasing the number of flats by a third) but this has seemingly been rejected by the council. The local council is also trying to get Capco to sell the local housing estates back that the developer secured in controversial fashion a number of years ago. All of this has served to reduce the current valuation of the scheme from £1.4bn in 2015 to half that amount early in 2018. We can see where this is heading and the signals suggest that Capco may well be looking for a way out.The point discussed by the Chelsea fans is as follows: rather than Roman spending £1bn+ to build a somewhat restricted (albeit beautiful) stadium at Stamford Bridge necessitating a four year exile at Wembley, why not build a great new stadium at Earls Court on a larger, less restricted site? This would mean that the club could play at SB while the building was taking place and then the site could be sold to developers once the club had moved into Earls Court thereby largely financing the overall scheme. Obviously, Earls Court was seriously discussed as an option in the past. Some Chelsea fans supported it at the time feeling that EC was close enough to SB for it to feel like home. Some supporters were adamant that it was Stamford Bridge or nowhere. What struck me in this recent discussion was that people who may have been in the second camp previously had seemingly rethought their stance after being confronted with the reality of a four year exile at Wembley (which was dreaded by all matchgoing fans). I think any such scheme would get the support of Chelsea fans and, crucially, the CPO to an extent that it wouldn't have a few years ago.So now we just need those pesky visa issues to be ironed out in quite a timely way. p.s. I notice from the previous discussion that there was a question about whether the housing estates would still need to be demolished for there to be space for a stadium. Do we know this for sure because I think any plans that would mean the loss of the estates would mean that a plan like this would be politically unacceptable (and therefore a non-starter)?
"
"
	Sounds like a solid plan. 42k isn't going to cut it anymore, plus there's money to be made with whatever the club decide to do with SB after a move
"
"
	Thanks for posting mate. Looks great to me and might give us a 60k plus ground, close to SB. May be the best idea so far. I keep my fingers crossed.
"
"
	So what happens to the club name if we move to Earls Court?  To use the club name would need a 75% CPO vote to allow it. 
"
"
	I'm sure this makes great commercial sense in the long run, for the extra 18k seats, but when it involves moving away from SB, i kind of hope it happens after i've gone and i'm 50 so hopefully it will be a few years yet.

	As much as I love the idea of a new stadium, look what it’s done to Arsenal and what it’s doing to Tottenham currently. 
"
"
	But if we don't build we are going to struggle top 4 every year
"
"
	How about digging down and also knocking down the shedend and building behind it? Maybe not enough to hit the 60'000 capacity but might be enough to get to 55'000, which would be good enough for us.
"
"
	We should think big - RA won´t live forever. If we move to Earls Court, Battersea or wheresoever, we should get an at least 50% bigger stadium. Ideal would be around 70k with no incease of ticket prices.

	Hate the thought of RA leaving, but there would be a queue of buyers for Chelsea FC.  One of the most well known names in football and in probably the most desirable area on the planet. But and this is a very big but, we would not get a new owner / owners who would have a fraction of Romans passion, commitment and pure love of football and his club CHELSEA FC.

			Let's be realistic and honest on this. We are a big club but Utd are a top 3 in the world mega club! We should not be comparing us with them! 
		"
"
			We're catching them. They still top the global shirt sales (as of 2017) with 2.85m, but we're in 4th with 1.65. We have an ever expanding global fanbase, great commercial deals and we've won a hell of a lot more than them in recent years. Unless they get back to winning titles again (or we drop off), there's no reason we can't close that gap significantly.
		"
"
			No question about it, Chelsea have come a very long way on and off the pitch over the last 25 years! But UTD are and probably always will be on another level to us in terms of size T
		"
"
	The away terrace used to hold 11,700 in the late 80s, not many occasions was it full. Especially after we were no longer allowed in there officially!!

	The state football is in at the moment, even if we didn’t sell any tickets we’d still be in profit thanks to TV deals. So I don’t see what the rush is for a new stadium.

			Good point, but I think we already do have a sexy stadium. As my User ID suggests I come from an era when SB looked very different than it does today, but 1978 or 2018, I still get the same buzz in my gut as I round the corner, where the club shop used to be and see the stadium in front of me. And to be honest an extra 18k seats isn't going to make me feel any different. I think she looks pretty sexy just the way she is.

	CPO AGM is to take place at the Bridge at 11.00am on Friday, 25 January 2019. I received my invitation and papers this morning. Will scan and post the papers on here in the next day or so. Could be an interesting meeting with the redevelopment of the stadium being put on hold.
"
"
	Thx Boyne for letting us know. "
"
	Yesterday was the CPO AGM. I went along with some of the guys I go the games with. There was about 100 people in attendance - recognised a few people from games and previous AGMs. Of the five people who make up the CPO board only two were in attendance. I'm not sure why the other three were at the meeting.

			Thanks for this Boyne.

	Cheers for the Facebook link @Boyne  maybe the club could do a better job getting these things out there.

			Pretty certain it was Ken's idea dkw. I have heard him speak of the situation at the time and his wish to make certain that the ground could never be purchased by developers again. Setting up the CPO scheme was the vehicle to ensure that.
		"
"
			For some reason I thought it was some fans who put the idea forward to Ken, not sure why though. Either way it was possibly the best idea anyone associated with our club has ever had.

	So spurs new ground opens today about time, but the worry I have is that we could be left behind by other clubs, I don't mean City Liverpool and Utd, but pains me to say it but potentially the three other main London clubs. I love the bridge and never want to move away, but are the club looking at the new sh*te Hart lane and thinking we need to pull our finger out, or are they content to play not second or third but fourth fiddle to the other London clubs.

			I could be wrong but I read somewhere that there’s still been no movement on the development of Battersea and that we could be trying to get back in there. I’m not massively keen on us moving far from SB but Battersea would be a good compromise if we have to move somewhere. That could be a really iconic stadium if it’s possible.

			Considering how far into the development they are, it is highly unlikely we would be able to turn that site into a football ground now. That ship has long sailed.

	The tone of the article suggests a cheaper version ('value engineered') of the scheme that currently has planning permission. So it would still be on the Stamford Bridge site but a budget reduction of ""£500 million"" would mean a serious scaling down of ambition.
"
"
	I wonder where this would leave Chelsea's stature as a club going forward; it is no surprise that Everton are looking to expand their stadium and grow as a club. We know how large the stadiums in the Bundesliga are already. Real Madrid and Barcelona, regardless if they are the biggest clubs in the world, are looking to expand to 100k
"
"
	If we go for a cut-price deal, what's the point of even doing it at all? We won't be able to do anywhere near as much and it'll be a massive drain of funds for very little purpose.
"
"
	Roman needs to build us the stadium we need or sell up to someone who will. After Spurs getting ""the best stadium in the world"" we cant be falling behind that rabble!
"
"
	There really isn't a viable site close to Stamford Bridge where buying up a huge plot of land would be a 'cheaper' option, even with the sale of Stamford Bridge to offset the costs. Certainly not to the tune of £500 mil. Earls Court, Sands End Gas Works etc will all be more lucrative to developers as residential schemes so why would they sell? All the old industrial Brownfield sites along the river have been snapped up. Plus the days of dropping a large stadium into tight residential streets are long gone, the opposition would be enormous. If we want to stay in Fulham it HAS to be Stamford Bridge, I think we'll see a resubmitted application 'no-frills' stadium.
"
"
	It's not about the size for me, but the quality. At the moment the bridge is very tired. It feels old. Something more modern is needed to help us stand out. Or at least fit in as at the moment we are standing out as a big club with a crap ground. 
"
"
			You'd rather that over a complete redesign....?
		"
"
			I'd rather see something get done than nothing which looks like where we are currently headed. At least this way the money could be managed and we wouldn't have to see the team play somewhere temporarily for 2 years. 
		"
"
	Fact is we need to upgrade the Bridge. There are 3 clubs in London that have a bigger and more modern stadium. This is a huge investment in our future. 
"
"
			To a large degree investing in a complete stadium re build or indeed splashing out too much is as about ego the dilemma is that ego often comes with a heavy price.

			I may be wrong but believe the money Roman has put in is a loan and would be recouped in the sale price.

			I have seen many media outlets over the years claim Roman converted the 'loan' into equity.

"
			Fordstam the clubs parent company owe him just over 1.1bn in the form of an interest free loan, which he can technically call in with 18 months notice.
		"
"
			Yes, but he owns Fordstam. So Roman owes Roman 1.1bn.
		"
"
			A better answer than I gave previously to your suggestion to rebuild existing stands. 
		"
"
			Indeed and he will want it back upon sale, which was the point of the other poster. The money he has put in is there in the accounts as a creditor.  Which probably accounts for his ‘asking price’ if you put the profit he feels he is entitled to on top.
		"
"
			What I was trying to say initially was if Roman sells lets hope the person who buys Chelsea is not a Glazer's type. The Glazer's look at Utd as a business, where as Roman is a genuine fan of Chelsea. Chelsea is more than a business to Roman.

			I'm a carer, so can't go.  Agree that it's an awful location to hold a final. But seeing where the next World Cup is being held, being stupid is something football's rulers are world class at.
		"
"
			The fact that you've also said you can't go, and suddenly seem to realise all the semantics about the location of the final makes me think you realise your previous statement almost blaming the matchgoers (or not in this case) is completely moronic? This has nothing to do with the fans not wanting to be at the final, it has to do with location, cost, the fact it's a midweek game, and the fact it's absolutely horrendous trying to get there.
		"
"
			Declining support? Absolute bollocks. Go and look at our average attendance compared to the stadium capacity instead of knee jerking over a single game where the attendance was slightly lower than usual. Our percentage of attendance to capacity remains one of the highest in the premier league.
		"
"
			It's not moronic to say the final is in a bad location, but also think it's  a poor show to have only 2000 fans from a club that likes to call itself one of the biggest clubs in the world. I bet the cost wouldn't stop Utd, Liverpool or even the likes of a Newcastle or Leeds from selling 6,000 tickets. Clubs from poorer parts of the country i might add.

	Minutes from the Chelsea Supporters Group Meeting on 11 September. Amongst other things the meeting discussed Safe Standing and the Stadium Redevelopment. The club's responses to questions about safe standing and the stadium redevelopment were that there no plans in the short term to introduce the former and there are no updates on the latter.

			You're correct. Hammersmith and Fulham Council granted approval in March 2017 and advanced works (not sure what that means)  have to start within three years of that. Page four of the document below refers to the three year clause. Demolition works have to start with five years. There are other deadlines. I assume - but am happy to be corrected - that if advance works don't start within three years that a new planning application will have to be submitted to the council.
		"
"
	Gut feeling says the stadium work is a dead duck.
"
"
			 
		"
"
	It always used to be that as long as SOME work listed in the planning application had started, that removed the deadline, but it's a long time since I was deeply involved with Planning Law, so that might have changed.
"
"
			You're welcome, Davey Baby. Agree, that it's looking less and less likely that the project will go ahead which will be a shame. I reckon that a new plan will be drawn up where the hotel, bars etc at the back of the Shed End will be knocked down and an extra tier is added to that stand. An extra tier on the MH stand would be nice but I think I read somewhere that because of the railway line that wouldn't be possible.
		"
"
			The extra stand in The Shed won't be ideal compared to the other options but if it's our only option then beggars can't be choosers.

	The scouse scum are going to over 60k , We really are going to be left behind.

			The extra stand in The Shed won't be ideal compared to the other options but if it's our only option then beggars can't be choosers.

			My understanding is that an increase in capacity is inhibited by the small entrances on the Fulham Rd and the last application only received approval because of the proposed additional concourse at the back of the North Stand (still can't call it the Matthew Harding) giving direct access to Fulham Broadway Station.
		"
"
			Is that because you can pretend The North Stand was named after you?

	Does having a bigger stadium actually have any substantial financial benefit? TV and sponsorship money is always on the rise, for the amount required to build the stadium including buying out and relocating businesses and renting a new place, I don't know how long it would take to actually reap the benefits and if it sizable enough to be worth the effort and risk of it effecting our football.
"
"
	It's such a curse to be located where we are. Imagine if the stadium had remained with the running track around it. We likely would have had a far easier time of expanding or rebuilding entirely.

			I dunno. It seems like it would have been a great atmosphere back in the day. 75,000 SB used to hold. I did read that when the initial redevelopment started around 50 years ago, there were plans to make the stadium a 50k seater, but didn't happen due to financial issues.

	Some great points mentioned above, especially the direness of an emirates style 'Echo chamber', i wonder why no one has thought to completely revamp SB, i mean to be honest its very Old School looking, and a bit dated, take out all the infra structure, and build a ground to be proud of, a 45000 mini Wembley style, i think the last thing we should do is lose our identity, i know West ham fans would never of wanted to lose U P, we are only going to get that Grand design if Romans slate is scrubbed clean.

			So the club who's match day revenues are half that of other London clubs and who are being overtaken by Liverpool and man city as global brands doesn't completely lose value.
		"
"
			Even if he has no need to do anything, by doing stuff it shows how much he's a great owner by doing these extra things that other owners don't do.
		"
"
			I'm merely pointing out that logically if he got the right offer, I think he'd sell.

	Think we should be thankful with the bridge as we have it, do we really want a ground like Arsenal, Spurs and West Ham? All those clubs have lost something since moving, atmosphere is the obvious one. The extra capacity would only be filled with corporate and foregein tourist fans who lend nothing to the atmosphere. I think we just need to put our energy into trying to create a better atmosphere inside the bridge.

"
"
			That's an important point. There's no point in taking solace in having a small stadium with half the revenue of our rivals by virtue of a small ground having a better atmosphere, when we barely have an atmosphere. In some respects, a larger capacity might not necessarily mean more tourist fans, but it might mean that those who can't afford or commit to season tickets can attend a few games and perhaps it is those fans that might provide an atmosphere instead of those who currently have possession of the season tickets?

	Personally think we should redevelop the Shed End seats and build backwards into the hotel area to get as close to 50k as we can.

I find it incredulous that they didn't know their own rules and PSG just get away with obvious cheating because UEFA are inept. It stinks and nobody does anything about it.

	Big New stadiums haven't helped the other London clubs at all. The need to increase revenue because of FFP  is given as the reason to increase capacity. But who says FFP  is here to stay ? I can see it being relaxed or abolished at some stage , the authorities just love money.

	Planning permission runs out in a few days, ( 31st March) can't see us reviving the new stadium plans. RA doesn't seem to want to renew his UK visa anyway, and doesn't even use the option on his Israeli passport to travel here. .

"
"
			It will not be possible to make the East and West Stands higher as there is a law which states that there must be a clear line of sight from a point in Richmond Park to St. Paul's Cathedral. That line of sight runs through Stamford Bridge. I think that it's possible to make the Shed End higher but there may be problems with the North Stand due to the railway which runs behind it.

			Those are exactly my thoughts on the Shed stand. I've always found it a bit insulting that the one part of the ground that was always full when the club was on it's arse is the most inadequate when looking at the stadium as it is. Tear down the Bates vanity project and give us a Shed end, reserved for home support only, to be proud of.
		"
"
			Too true, it's the worst that the away fans are down there as well.
		"
"
			Whether we stay with the bridge as it is or redevelop it, we like many clubs will still have the problem who frequents it, I don't mean the hardcore but the theatre going tourist lot, that don't add anything to the atmosphere apart from pound notes in the club shop, while off at the moment watched some old 80's games on you tube, we had some passionate support in those days.

			I've only been to the new Wembley, so I can't make a sweeping comparison between the Bridge and new stadiums, but Wembley has as much charm as the M25. New stadiums may have more bling (and toilets), but essentially they are soulless bowls. Give me that old dump of a Bridge anytime. I just hope if the new stadium ever is built, it will still have charm. At least judging from the model the outside isn't as bad and predictable as for instance the New Library.

	Don't know of anyone can help but I'm thinking about building a coffee table sized model of Stamford bridge and I want it relatively to scale but I can not find dimensions anywhere on Google all I can find is pitch dimensions and it seems no matter what combinations of words I use that is all I get. Also advice anyone...I am going to cover the top with glass and actually use it as a coffee table(instead of coffee it will be beer) the issue is all the stands are different heights. You think I should use the east/west stands as a base line and having the glass butt upto the hotel or have the glass inset a few inches so it's covering the pitch?

	Roman's decision not to build the stadium when he did (for his own reasons) has turned out to be the BEST financial decision he could have made. COVID, no crowds, reduced revenues etc, would have made the debt very difficult to service, if not impossible -  look at how our old mates in N17 are struggling 🤣

"
"
	Completely agree that timing was on our side given the pandemic.  That said, SB really is end of life as far as stadiums go, and I would love to see us revive plans to renovate or rebuild.  Great stadium, but by modern standards it is lagging.  Capacity is a misleading indicator, but even there we are 9th on PL list, and will be 10th when Everton complete Bramley-Moore.  Outside England, look across Spain or Italy and they're all moving ahead.  Fingers crossed this picks up again

	If the ground is knocked down and a new one built I wonder if there will be hotel attached. It may have to be smaller than the current one but a hotel would bring in extra revenue for the club. Also at the moment there is the Under the Bridge club which is used for concerts etc. If the club decides to build down i.e. have a stadium similar to the Camp Nou where the lower tier is below street level. Could see no more Under the Bridge club unless that is built even lower than it is at the moment. Am not sure how much revenue Under the Bridge and the hotel - and restaurants - bring to the club but I guess the board are looking at all ways to bring in money.

	The only thing I can think of that’s missing is the Marketing aspect of having a world class stadium, which equates to an almost invisible monetary value and something that the Marketing team will attempt to make sense of through various metrics. The increase in ‘brand value’ from having a modern/bigger stadium is similar to trying to measure the number of people who see and get affected by a poster ad on the tube, almost impossible but nonetheless.

			100 % agree with this if we can stay at the Bridge then we should 50 years next year since my first game at the Bridge and I just can't imagine playing anywhere else some people want a move that's their opinion and I respect it.

			Not convinced of that they have a lot more local support then we have our support comes from a wider area and the majority isn't that local.

		"
"
			I've never seen Spurs and Arsenal get crowds of 20,000 for any game Arsenal's lowest crowd for the league cup last season was 56,000, Hammersmith has a lot of QPR fans it's not entirely Chelsea Croydon is definitely not an all Chelsea area loads of Palace round there. Sutton is 10 miles from the Bridge so not exactly on our doorstep.. Crowds of 30.000 odd including away support under sanctions so you're saying we will double our home support and sell out every game I can't see it, If we have to go to Wembley Sutton is 20 miles away how many are likely to travel midweek in the rush hour against say Burnley if they get promoted it will definitely affect numbers.
		"
"
			why west ham is so popular in london, btw?
		"
"
			Crowds of 30k under sanctions? That's how many were allowed to come. We got 36k for the league cup home fixture last season and we charge more than arsenal or Tottenham. 
		"
"
			Well West Ham do sell out every week despite their fans hating the place and it was season ticket holders under sanctions how many more thousands of st holders do you think we will attract with a 60,000 stadium especially if prices go up God knows how much admission will be in 5/10 years.
		"
"
			I think you're confused, when under sanctions season ticket holders were the only ones allowed to go. So there's no relevance to this discussion as under sanctions Stamford bridge was effectively a sell out (we sold every single ticket available). 
		"
"
			Yes I know st holders were the only ones allowed in that's why I said it. 28,000 approx st holders under sanctions you say an extra 6-8k and the rest of your figures add up to 47,000. Our capacity at the moment is 40,300 not 42 which I think you are claiming. You have to start from 28,000 as the base figure that's how many season tickets we have plus 3,000 away support so only 9,000 go on general sale. Can we double that with new st holders and general sale every week I'm not so sure especially like I said this won't be happening anytime soon.

			Hating Spurs and NFL isn't a valid argument against it's the best stadium in the country. It's arguably the best stadium in Europe. If we played there as a neutral ground (e.g. old school fa cup semi final) it would have more demand than any other stadium to go there - and not just so we could rip it up.

			I don't know in the US, but certainly in Europe Chelsea is more known than Spurs, no matter how shiny their toilet-looking stadium is.

			You said every fan you know wants to go there which is such a sweeping statement and not true it's an impressive stadium in one of the most downtrodden parts of London.  We haven't got that stadium so what sort of point that makes I don't know we don't have the Emirates either and when was the last time Chelsea fans or any other fans tore up a ground it's 2023 not 1983 which is the last time I remember us doing that at the Baseball Ground.

It's an impressive football stadium not one of the seven wonders of the world and nice back tracking about tearing up the ground.

	Reading the comments above, the general consensus seems to be that there is no benefit to a new bigger and modern stadium. Nobody cares what your stadium looks like, it has negligible effect on revenue and costs a fortune to do. I guess nobody told that to Real Madrid, Spurs, Arsenal, Man City (who are adding another 7700 seats) Bayern Munich, the two Lisbon clubs, Juventus, Ajax and probably a good few others.

	Speculation that Boehly wants the new stadium in Earls Court and having weighed everything up I'm for it. Apparently the choices are move for up to 4 years probably Wembley or stay at the Bridge till Earls Court is built that for me is the most sensible option. Wembley would be a disaster apathy would soon set in if we keep having seasons like we are now on top of extra travel for most fans and the atmosphere won't be great anyone who went to England games at Wembley in the 80's 30,000 in a massive stadium makes for a terrible atmosphere.

		"
"
	Pretty crude, but it would sort of fit, but only if it bridged the railway line in some way. And that I imagine is quite unlikely.
"
"
	Kind of in two minds about the move. Obvious sentiment is we stay at Stamford Bridge and stay true to our roots but the more it goes on the more unfeasible it seems to redevelop and we're clearly lacking behind every other 'big' club in terms of home ground. I've certainly softened to the idea of moving elsewhere over the last few years and Earl's court is only a 15-20 minute walk from our current home. Being able to play at the Bridge whilst it is built is huge too, certainly don't want to be at Wembley for 4 years while we redevelop in the current location.

	in regards to room at Earl’s Court 
"
"
			Agree completely about Wembley and apathy would set in. I may be wrong but when Spurs played there they couldn't use all the seats due to restrictions imposed by the local council. If wrong, please correct. Staying at the Bridge until a stadium is built at Earl's Court would, as you say, be the sensible option. The Earl's Court area covers a wide area. It's easy to get to and there are a few pubs nearby and pubs near the Bridge e.g. the Chelsea Pensioner are within walking distance especially if you cut through Brompton Cemetery. I would be in my late sixties come 2028 and a couple of the building I go to the games with would be in their mid-seventies so the sooner the redevelopment started the better.

			So it's pretty much got to go straight over the top of the railway line ... I'd imagine that's a huge complication ... huge additional cost just for starters.
		"
"
			in regards to room at Earl’s Court 
		"
"
			Its a nice idea but average attendances for a women's game is about 4k, would be crazy to keep Stamford Bridge for that. Not to mention the resale value like you said, which would subsidise some of the new stadium costs. 
		"
"
	Along the same lines as SF, if it is feasible, it would be great for the Bridge to be kept for our women's side. Would mean all that history would be kept for us, for Chelsea. A great statement.
"
"
			You're probably right, certainly some low crowds at Kingsmeadow, but they did get 38,300 for the home game against Tottenham ... the only ladies game this season that has been played at Stamford Bridge. Was there a reason that was so much higher than normal ?
		"
"
			One thing I like about that is that there is a lot of land besides that required for a pitch and stands. Having seen the article about City's 'campus', they have a neat little stadium adjacent that hosts the womens, youth and academy sides. It's also used for some amateur cup finals that boosts community relations. They've also got a large shop, other buildings and a fan park area on site. The fan park is planned to be covered given the Manchester climate and a large indoor venue planned is planned for concerts etc that will have a 23'000 capacity.
		"
"
			An old pic of the Exhibition Centre, gives some idea of what a large structure might look like on what is now an empty lot ...  
		"
"
			If we paid for it maybe we could convince BR to drivert the railway around or dig down so it passes underneath the new stadium.

			You will never gate any major stadium selling out week in week out for women's football. When a club gets to a cup semi- final or final and sell 30,000 tickets it happens even at non league level their next home game then attracts the usual couple of thousand that's what happens regarding attendances at women's football. Happened to us back in the day 42,000 against Liverpool loads locked out great day few days later Cardiff at home 9,000 turned up. 
"
"
			You are right about Spurs their crowds fluctuated from 40,000 to near capacity at Wembley. As regards Matthew Harding it's hard to say because his money wouldn't have gone into a new stand like it did at the Bridge but I'm sure something could and should be in his honour.  Richard Attenborough was a famous fan but that's about it regardless of him keeping his shares, as for Roman that will never happen Boehly will see this as his vision and it would be a political powder keg to name a stand after him.

			As we should, but it's different levels of punishment. If we fail to hit our targets for profit, we get punished with points. City however are fraudulently claiming they have...and it's just obvious they are. Their punishment should and could be expulsion.

			Fair but I think as bisright pointed out, there are some commercial benefits that come with having a new stadium beyond matchday revenue. Not sure what the reception will be towards our stadium having a commercial name like the Allianz, Etihad or Emirates but I imagine that's what our owners will do for a new stadium considering they are very much interested in replicating the Red Bull and Man City model. That probably will cut down on the expenses of the stadium.

	Loads of empty seats tonight anyone who thinks that a 60,000 capacity stadium whether it be at the bridge, Earls Court or four or five seasons at Wembley will be a sellout every week is frankly deluded we are at a crossroads and to be honest 40,000 is more than enough the way things are going.
"
"
			Yes, and I guess Jonathan Goldstein on the board has extensive experience of real estate and property development to get best value in any building work, and if we do leave the Bridge then the sale of prime land along the Fulham Road will offset a lot of the new stadium cost.

	I have looked at modelling what a stand-by-stand redevelopment would be like. I have kept the existing West stand, and one at a time, demolished the other three stands, with each being replaced by a new stand using the West stand profile, to create a completed seating bowl.

			Todd hired highly respected architect Janet Marie Smith, she has had a huge impact on baseball stadium architecture in America. I suggest you do some research on her. 
		"
"
	Janet Marie Smith, while working for Stan Kasten, led the project to convert Turner Field to an Olympic Stadium. The stadium was the centerpiece for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. Later, Smith oversaw the transformation of Olympic Stadium to the Braves' Turner Field. Much of the north end of the Olympic stadium was removed to convert it into a 49,000-seat baseball park. A unique characteristic of Smith's work on Braves' Turner Field is the remnants of previously demolished Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium's foundation which is located just outside the center field and left field walls. Retaining the former Atlanta-Fulton foundation allowed the spot where home plate had been to be marked, thereby commemorating the place at which Hank Aaron broke Babe Ruth's home run record in 1974.

	Bit off subject but are there any fellow Chelsea Pitch Owners on here? The next AGM is on 19 January and I've received the invitation and other paperwork but four of the people I go to the games with and who are CPOs haven't received there papers. If there are any CPOs on here have you received yours. Thanks.

	Fulham on Saturday tickets are on general sale I've said it before it's completely naive to think we could sell out 60,000 every home West Ham do it Spurs can do it is irrelevant. Chelsea have a hardcore of about 25-30,000 fans members they tend to be not always casual fans who pick and choose what games they attend I'm in that bracket myself.  When Mourinho got sacked first time round after a Champions League game the crowd was 25,000 wasn't a glamour tie but still not a great attendance. If we are mid table for a couple more seasons or worse the clamour for tickets by tourists will also be on the wane. Season tickets are on the rise I can see the numbers also dropping off especially as Boehly is only interested in corporate tossers and not average Chelsea fans. Finally I have typed this on my phone apologies for spacing etc.

		"
"
			Yeah probably, the football is dire and there isn't a huge appetite to go from many fans.
		"
"
			Good points there and if the football is not entertaining or we are not successful then more than 60k seems OTT, still I guess the owners could lease it for other events.........
		"
"
			I don't know if it's blind loyalty or denial but if you think everything is ok with the average match going Chelsea fan then you are completely wrong. I don't know how often you go or have gone to  games but I know loads of Chelsea fans who don't go to home games anymore. The atmosphere is sterile it's full of tourists taking selfies especially in the West lower and the football is terrible. The disconnection between Boehly etc and the fans is getting wider there's no love for him like there was for Roman he's also determined to have more corporate fans than normal fans. If we did get a 60,000 stadium do you seriously not think they are exactly the type of fans he's trying to attract. For us old enough to remember the debacle of the 70's overreaching after success then building the East Stand with the team in decline (there were other factors) it's not unlikely it could happen again seeing as we have lost more games than anyone else in the calendar year. 
		"
"
			I'm not sure that will necessarily be the case.

			Talk is cheap yellow wall at Chelsea please will never happen. He's shut down Under the Bridge turned it into an executive club done more or less the same with the East Lower. No European football or challenging for major honours after 2 decades of success disillusioned fans a cost of living crisis that is not going away season tickets hike and general admission will go up and you talk about building a Dortmund type wall Germany where football is so much cheaper where local fans watch their club get your head out of the sand mate.

			Well, all we can do is see what happens ... but I don't think for one minute they are intending to run the normal fan out of the club, and I'm sure in due course we'll all find out what they have in plan for the stadium re-development. The Stoll land acquisition is clearly the start of it ...

	Something the new owners will have to look at with the current stadium. We have an ageing support regarding season tickets. When you get to 65 for example in the MHU where I am, a season ticket goes from £880 to £440.

			It’s just Westview not selling out since they whacked the prices up by over 50% because you can get decentish scran up there now.

	There doesn’t seem to be any news from The Earls Court Development, the councils involved, or Chelsea themselves.
"
"
	Earls court is the only way, I just don't see how redeveloping, or rebuilding on site, the Bridge is going to be profitable enough for the owners.
"
"
	Looking at those figures , Tottenham get roughly £40 odd million more matchday income than us than us per YEAR.
"

	Personally I believe the Bridge is too expensive to redevelop for the limited amout of extra seat we would get, and the CPO don't appear to be willing to approve moving, even if Earls court was possible.

	Following the talk about the stadium and the CPO ""dragging us down"" in Todd's thread, where would people like to move the new Stamford Bridge that is realistic? Battersea station is off the table, so do not say it as an option, and Earl's Court is also not possible as the Council and the owners don't want it to happen. What other options in London, West, Central, South... are there? Cobham or Kingsmedow are a pain to get to and would be as soulless as West Ham's London Stadium and surroundings, anywhere else in London?

			No one's suggesting Battersea. Anyone who lives in London wouldn't suggest it. 
		"
"
			I agree with you in all your points except in that Battersea was an option at some point and many fans (including myself and some others I go to football with) thought our stadium there would have looked really nice. Yesterday someone mentioned it and said it would have been awesome. And it is a very well known fact in this forum that you need to mention unavailable options at least once a week 😉 
		"
"
			Yes Battersea was an option and would have been awesome. The reason we didn't get it had nothing to do with the CPO though but because it was sold to someone else.
		"
"
	Thread was started in 2013. 11 years and 2 ownerships later still the same Bridge.
"
"
			I wonder if there is any scope in making a play for the corner of Battersea Park, right opposite the power station ? Where the athletics stadium and the tennis courts are ?
		"
"
			If we want to develop a top stadium at the Bridges site we need to buy more land around it, make the land mass similar in size to Earls court.
		"
"
			I was thinking that when looking at the map ... basically the club needs to buy every building between the ground and the Fulham Road, which will probably take several decades !

			Strongly agree. if we can’t do anything at the Bridge we need to seriously consider other options even if they’re slightly further afield. Earls Court would’ve been perfect but that’s been ruled out. Anymore recent news on the situation at Old Oak Common?

			Old oak common? I'd be surprised if the CPO ever allowed that. 
		"

			Strongly agree. if we can’t do anything at the Bridge we need to seriously consider other options even if they’re slightly further afield.
		"
"
	I think the club should redevelop my house in to less of a sh*t tip as practice for redeveloping a stadium. Please email Boehly if you agree. 
"
"
			I hear you. Old Oak is far from my first choice but i struggle to see how many viable options are left. Earls Court(my 1st choice) is seemingly off the table. Battersea is obviously a no-go now, same with White City. If there’s no way of redeveloping the Bridge we’re going to have to make a huge decision 
		"
"
			We are getting left behind.
		"
"
	Heard Boehly is looking into bulldozing the Bridge and moving us to the Amex.
"

			We can redevelop the bridge.

	Clubs with bigger stadiums seems to get away with FFP, which is the main attraction of it despite the club has to take a huge loan to build it, and it isn't going to build itself in 6 months. Roman with all the cash couldn't ( or didn't) get it done, so be curious to see how the new owners could do it.  You take a huge mortgage, you get the rest of your life ( or longer) to pay for it. Unlike a house, I doubt a club could sell the stadium
"

	Well, I won’t be seeing.
"
"
			Spurs have gone from £45 million match day revenue to ,£100 million a year .

			That's true , but a £2 billion layout for an additional £110 m a year which we usually throw away on just one player doesn't seem to make sense .

			You obviously noticed the empty seats the other night Newcastle sold their full allocation if we were playing Burnley, Sheffield United or Wolves there would have been at least another 1,500 empty seats. The empty seats in the West Stand will happen again before the end of the season guaranteed , The club are on the decline the disconnect between the fans and the board and management is massive and then you have to factor in this sort of pricing 60,000 stadium never going to happen not with these septic tanks running things.  
"
"
			The game against Newcastle was a sell out. Season ticket holders not coming to a Monday night game doesn't change things
		"

			Go back to the sanctions where were the most empty seats the West Lower very few season ticket holders in that part of the ground and if you sit there it's like the league of nations this is where the majority of tourists sit.

	I thought this was an interesting aerial view of what Roman had approved.
"
"
			They'll re-design both ends for a conversion to safe standing I reckon. That's probably the cheapest and easiest way to get the capacity up, as apparently you can get a 1.8x multiplier of fan numbers for the same footprint. MH capacity I have seen quoted at 10,884, so if that went to 100% safe standing then you could get 19,591 fans in it. Do the same at the Shed End and you're up to 60K+ overall (2x 19,591 with West Stand c13,500 ; East Stand c11,000). Approval for safe standing at football grounds is apparently coming soon from the powers that be ... 
		"

			Sorry I don't follow you. Mathew Harding lower and the shed are safe standing and didn't increase the capacity at all.

		"

			That's probably true of a lot of councils. The Council will no doubt argue that there first obligation is to the residents rather than to the club unless Chelsea can prove that extra events and more people will bring additional revenue to area to ease the inconvenience of road closures. Saying that, given the poor standard of - and the high cost - of food and drink in Stamford Bridge people may want to eat and drink in pubs, cafes etc in the area. It would be nice if as part of the redevelopment of the ground the standard of food and drink improved.
		"
"
			Good comments Boyne. As for concerts , what's stopping them being held at The Bridge now ?
		"
"
			Thank you. Good question about concerts at the Bridge. I don't know if the club has approached the club has approached the council about concerts. Perhaps one could be held as a test to gauge responses from local residents.  I think you're right about Oasis hosting a gig at Maine Road. I know that there were concerts in Under The Bridge but I think the last one was a couple of years ago but I could be wrong. I only went to Earl's Court once for a gig and that was to see Bob Dylan in 1981. I think it was the largest indoor venue in London.

			Just had a quick look on the Hammersmith and Fulham Council planning page to see if there is anything about the application made a few years back but nothing there. Guess the paperwork was removed when the last application expired. As you say, you would hope the club plans for as much as possible.

			Hi mate. 
		"

			Boyne - if you after a link for Roman's planning application documents, here you go ... 179 documents !
		"
"
			Thank you. Will have a look through the documents. Interesting that the documents are on the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC) Council website. I think that shows that despite The Bridge being in the Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham RBKC Council will have to be consulted e.g. because of the impact on Brompton Cemetery and the coming and going of builders.
		"
"
			Spending on infrastructure isn't included in FFP I think I'm right in saying.
		"
"
			Hi Boyne
		"
"
			Hi mate, not sure about the rules. Have to admit that I haven't read the PL's rules in great depth. I probably should do but delving into the ins and outs of accounting would probably bore me to death. I worked in the Civil Service and trying to get around Government accounting was a nightmare.
		"
"
			If thats the case why are so many people crying about our owners and how we've spent a lot on players as if that takes away from a stadium? They are both unrelated, and with the amount of money at our disposal, spending £1-2bn on a new stadium is clearly affordable and they are very willing to get it done.

			I agree. I'd also like to see the East Stand go (it's 50 years old FFS). It could be so much better if they extended it over the railway line, and I'm sure a rebuild could easily add a few thousand seats, to go with extended rebuilds behind each goal.

Remember being up there v West Ham 1980- was transfixed by the action in Shed by the Tea Bar- pocket of West Ham got in early- Chelsea were above them and for the course of the game police separated the two, with the odd skirmish every ten minutes or so…” Old man…stopping looking at the Shed, there’s a game going on down here”

			I remember reading a quote from Ken Bates about the East Stand (which I can't find online). He said something like 'That stand is a monument to bad design', and highlighted the failure to incorporate decent facilities, from modern dressing rooms, to offices, to fitness rooms, to hospitality etc. It wasn't just that it nearly bankrupted us and wrecked the club for over two decades. It was a missed opportunity to give the club a lot more than just seats to watch a game. I'd be happy to see it replaced with something bigger* and better.

			Yeah I remember Bates moaning about the lack of money making facilities etc.  I'm thinking of moving to East Upper next season, can't get on with standing up in MHL anymore.. If I remember there's obstructed views right at the back with concrete pillars?
		"
"
			Remember to get your Vertigo tablets, if you are near the top 😉 There are quite a lot of ex MHL & MHU fans up there now
		"
"
			I think the footprint of the stand can't be much bigger than the old east stand. There's info on the rake in a book I've got somewhere, I remember the view always being good though.  f**k , dunno what to do . West lower maybe . 
		"
"
	Regarding East Stand chatter. I can’t think of any other stands being built during this era. Think Everton’s triple decker went up late 60’s, Villa, Forest Wolves and Spurs has new developments around the 1980 mark.
"
"
	Just checked. Goodison Stand was 71. Btw working with a scouser recently, who told me they introduced random drug testing of the new stadium build workforce. Failure rate was so high they stopped drug testing.
"
"
			No, not West Lower, We came out of there because of the huge tourist concentration and total lack of atmosphere. We went to Shed Upper 😉
"
"
😂 I've had season tickets in every stand apart from East. I just don't wanna have to stand up all game, yeah West lower atmosphere was dire, West Upper was brilliant view , padded seats about 4 rows from the front and Abramovich' s security guys at the front getting "" sit dahn"" abuse when they stood up ,  and a fecking red hot heater that roasted your head . Can only remember one game when it was turned on though . 
		"
"
	I like west lower these days , save my legs ready for the walk to Earl’s Court . Last 2 games Fulham Broadway closed.
"
"
	I'm a ST holder in the west lower. Love the view but unless it's a big game the atmosphere is poor. Away games are always better and I believe this is due to the age of the travelling support. I'm not as young as I used to be but still love a sing song but I look around and the majority of the west lower are either retired or tourists. 
"
"
	I’m in a season ticket club at work , apply for every game and hope lucky in the draw.

			I think the atmosphere and what we're watching go together. It doesn't matter if it's prime Chelsea top of the table football either,  effort, passion and giving everything gets fans behind the team.
		"
"
			My ST is in the MHU and there is no safe standing there. Occasionally some people stand but only during movements of high excitement. So not much this season! Some of the people I go to the games with have seats in the Shed Upper and are not happy having to stand. They blame old age and dodgy knees! I know what they mean. My ST for the women's games at Kingsmeadow is for one of the terraces. I have a dodgy knee and it sometimes plays up. Comes from standing in the same place for too long.

			Hi Sconnie.

Last week on the news was an article on the Paris Olympic Games. They showed temporary stands and stadia being built. It occurred to me that if you move away from Stamford Bridge, you have to rent Wembley Stadium or wherever. Why not erect a temporary stadium at Earls Court whilst the new stadium is constructed? I did think of a possible new stadium with Fulham sharing as a possibility but that ship may have sailed now.
"
"
	We might need a temporary stadium for about 5-6 years.  Not sure if that's a bit too permanent for a temporary stadium.  IE The Paris one will come down imediately after the games and ours will just get rusty and potentially unsafe over a much longer period. 
"
"
	I thought they were just going to do a stand at a time? Surely that’s easier, albeit lower attendances for a few seasons!

	With this new spending cap , does it make any sense to build a bigger stadium if spending is not related to revenues but based on a multiple of the TV income of the bottom club ?
"
"
			And what about clubs who could actually get into debt by spending up to the imposed limit?

			Can't see the council agreeing to a temporary stadium in the Earl's Court area. If a stadium were to be approved for Earl's Court I expect the council would want it to be permanent. Probably academic as I'm sure the area is set aside for housing, shops and amenities e.g. gym and cinema.

	Our ST seats are MHU and I love my seat, I'd be pretty miffed if I had to pay extra because of where the seat is as I bought it when they built the MHU and were looking at people to buy 5 year season tickets to raise money - cost us 4k for two tickets at the time which was a pretty loyal investment considering we weren't doing particularly well at the time.   The whole point of giving them that much money was so I could hand pick my seat!

"
			Having a bigger stadium isn't to help with FFP. It's to boost our revenues and therefore our value. 
		"
"
			I'd forgotten about the 5 year season ticket. I moved to the MHU from the West Stand in 1997 the year after it opened. I can't remember how much I paid for it but have renewed it on a season by season basis. My seat is just to the right of the goal as you look from the stand and like you I'd be miffed if I had to pay for more because of where I sit.
		"
"

"
"
	Matchday revenue is considered as operational revenue for FFP. 
"
"
			Quite. Tottenham rake in £100m annually from their match-day takings.
		"
"
			More importantly is that they now earn more in commercial revenue than us. That is because of the stadium. 
		"
"
			But they are having to repay the loans to build the stadium.
		"
"
			Yes exactly. We need to do it now. 
		"
"
	Good old Bates.

	Hi mate , you need to be a member from last season and then have enough points to get a season ticket this season. The points needed varies each season.
"
"
			Yes, info about ST renewals will be published on Monday. Like you, I prefer a card. 
		"
"
			I kept getting emails that I needed to register on the app followed by messages that I had registered successfully. Then a few days later it all starts again.

			Plenty of coverage here (I live in Leinster) and all the commentators were saying it was the best stadium they had ever been in. Feckin' Sp***.
		"
"
			I'll check but I think I got emails about registering for the app. Will go through my emails. Last season I had ST for the men's team and the women's team. If the App does replace the card it will only be for Stamford Bridge; a card will be still required for Kingsmeadow. 
		"
"
			I've just renewed. Same seat unfortunately, can only move if I have a medical condition and can provide proof.
		"
"
			I'll probably renew sometime next week. Always leave it late as possible. Doesn't seem right to me giving people less than two weeks to renews. Bloody daft that you can't move unless you have a medical condition. Sometimes people just want to move. Three people I know had season tickets in the Matthew Harding Upper moved to the Shed Upper at the start of last season. None of them has a medical condition; they just wanted a ""change of scenery"". And moving isn't going to result in paying less to the club; in fact it could mean paying more.
		"
"
			Yes you used to just request a move. I think the site said that due to time shortage you can't request a move without a medical condition. The shortage of time is down to the club FFS.
		"
"
	The fact that all these conditions to get a ST is a good thing no? Means there is still more demand over supply. As long as we keep filling the stadium even in these darkish times shows that we have a loyal fanbase.

			I've filled in online form to doctors surgery requesting a medical note after the ticket office said they might consider a move.
		"
"
			Hope you're successful in getting a move. Daft of the club not granting a move. It would be interesting to know how many fans apply to move each season. Excluding those who move who move from the Family Section as they are too old I suspect it's not a lot but could be wrong.
		"
"
			I think this is the first time the medical condition has been applied. You don't wanna swap do you Boyne ? 🤣🤣🤣
"
"
			Alas no. If I was a lot younger I may consider but now that I'm an old git! I wonder if the club is legally allowed to implement such a rule. Guess it's too late to challenge.
		"
"
			There should be an old codger section, blankets provided to drape over our legs at no extra cost. They will be sticking the Chelsea Pensioners in the Shed Upper safe standing if it's not stopped.
		"
"
			I'm going to see if I can get a seat at Kingsmeadow for the women's team. Had a standing ST last season and occasionally my legs played up. 
		"
"
			We’re looking to move to the North Stand, my old man struggles to stand if we can’t find somewhere to lean and people are pretty selfish in the amount of space they take up in the south stand. We had a family spread out with bags etc. once who refused to close in so an old man could lean on the bars until, of course, their mates all turned up and suddenly there was more room.
		"

	Well behind the curve and watching All or Nothing- Spurs under Jose from a few years back.

			The stadium alone earns them £100m+ annually. On top of whatever the NFL pays them, they pocket every penny spent on food, drink, hospitality boxes, etc, on the day. Just as when they hosted the Rugby Premiership final last weekend with 61,000 in attendance. They're sitting on a gold mine.

			Devils advocate a trifle….Wembley, Twickenham, Spurs, West Ham, all vying for non football pay days. Should we go big and redevelop we are entering a very complétive market. In terms of hoovering up match day food and drink expenditure- Tottenham is a total sh*thole- always has been, always will be. Very little outside the ground options- unlike us who despite recent pub/ restaurant closures, still have by far the most licensed premises on our doorstep than any other club. 
		"

			We beat every one of those on location.

	Tonight's flavour of what the revenue opportunities might be like for our new stadium ... if we ever get one  🙂 
"
"
			You can slice it up anyway you want, spending a billion on a stadium- outlay versus post construction revenue- anyone with half a brain would realise it would take decades to pay for itself 
		"
"
			There more to it than paying for itself with tickets, its also adding value as an asset to the club.

			I definitely read that article but can't find it now. I know residents were angry about the Stoll mansions sale because of rumours that some military vets would be made homeless, but it all got sorted .
		"
"
	I think they worked it out in the end but some of them will be relocated outside the Borough but close enough still.
"
"
			That’s very much the point add in the impact of inflation and in a blink of an eye the cost is swallowed up or at least in real terms diminished 
		"
"
			Yeah, i think its being lost a bit that payback for all this isnt only on footfall, it also means the club can borrow at lower rates etc due to a higher asset value, and probably loads of other financial twaddle us mere mortals would never understand ha ha...
		"
"
			Does anyone still believe this ownership are geninually trying to redevelop the stadium?
		"
"
			Exactly, spuds have won FA and are now valued more than us. As a fan not my major worry. As an owner/ investor thats all it is about.
		"
"
	Though I appreciate they have a billion pound asset. Not sure what the estimated cost of our rebuild was. Construction material costs have risen hugely over last couple of years.
"
"
			How much can they make as things are? 
		"
"
	So many challenges here.  Building costs (materials, construction cost, interest on loans) have soared, all somewhat compounded by our location.  Would be great to see some plans this coming season - love the Bridge (mainly location), but its old and too small.  I've never really missed the old wooden seat west stand, and am sure I'd feel the same about a new SB. 
"

	They had a net spend on players of 140m in 22/23 and 150m in 23/24.
"
"
			Perspective. Their borrowings are at only 2.9% and mostly over a 25 year period. In the meantime, the stadium alone earns them 100m a year, thus 2.5bn over a 25 year period. They're more than okay.
